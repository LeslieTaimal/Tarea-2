TI  - Stingray Venom Proteins: Mechanisms of Action Revealed Using a Novel Network 
      Pharmacology Approach.
LID - 10.3390/md20010027 [doi]
LID - 27
AB  - Animal venoms offer a valuable source of potent new drug leads, but their mechanisms 
      of action are largely unknown. We therefore developed a novel network pharmacology 
      approach based on multi-omics functional data integration to predict how stingray 
      venom disrupts the physiological systems of target animals. We integrated 10 million 
      transcripts from five stingray venom transcriptomes and 848,640 records from three 
      high-content venom bioactivity datasets into a large functional data network. The 
      network featured 216 signaling pathways, 29 of which were shared and targeted by 70 
      transcripts and 70 bioactivity hits. The network revealed clusters for single 
      envenomation outcomes, such as pain, cardiotoxicity and hemorrhage. We carried out a 
      detailed analysis of the pain cluster representing a primary envenomation symptom, 
      revealing bibrotoxin and cholecystotoxin-like transcripts encoding pain-inducing 
      candidate proteins in stingray venom. The cluster also suggested that such 
      pain-inducing toxins primarily activate the inositol-3-phosphate receptor cascade, 
      inducing intracellular calcium release. We also found strong evidence for 
      synergistic activity among these candidates, with nerve growth factors cooperating 
      with the most abundant translationally-controlled tumor proteins to activate pain 
      signaling pathways. Our network pharmacology approach, here applied to stingray 
      venom, can be used as a template for drug discovery in neglected venomous species.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in type 2 diabetes: 
      A systematic review and mixed-treatment comparison analysis.
PG  - 524-536
LID - 10.1111/dom.12849 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To compare efficacy and safety of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists 
      (GLP-1RAs) in people with type 2 diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We electronically 
      searched, up to June 3, 2016, published randomized clinical trials lasting between 
      24 and 32 weeks that compared a GLP-1RA (albiglutide, dulaglutide, twice-daily 
      exenatide and once-weekly exenatide, liraglutide, lixisenatide, semaglutide and 
      taspoglutide) with placebo or another GLP-1RA. Data on cardiometabolic and safety 
      outcomes were analysed using a mixed-treatment comparison meta-analysis. RESULTS: A 
      total of 34 trials (14 464 participants) met the inclusion criteria; no published 
      data for semaglutide were available. Compared with placebo, all GLP-1RAs reduced 
      glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels (reductions 
      ranged from -0.55% and -0.73 mmol/L, respectively, for lixisenatide to -1.21% and 
      -1.97 mmol/L, respectively, for dulaglutide). There were no differences within 
      short-acting (twice-daily exenatide and lixisenatide) or long-acting (albiglutide, 
      dulaglutide, once-weekly exenatide, liraglutide and taspoglutide) groups. Compared 
      with twice-daily exenatide, dulaglutide treatment was associated with the greatest 
      HbA1c and FPG reduction (0.51% and 1.04 mmol/L, respectively), followed by 
      liraglutide (0.45% and 0.93 mmol/L, respectively) and once-weekly exenatide (0.38% 
      and 0.85 mmol/L, respectively); similar reductions were found when these 3 agents 
      were compared with lixisenatide. Compared with placebo, all GLP-1RAs except 
      albiglutide reduced weight and increased the risk of hypoglycaemia and 
      gastrointestinal side effects, and all agents except dulaglutide and taspoglutide 
      reduced systolic blood pressure. When all GLP-1RAs were compared with each other, no 
      clinically meaningful differences were observed in weight loss, blood pressure 
      reduction or hypoglycaemia risk. Albiglutide had the lowest risk of nausea and 
      diarrhoea and once-weekly exenatide the lowest risk of vomiting. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      RCTs in the present analysis show that all GLP-1RAs improve glycaemic control, 
      reduce body weight and increase the risk of adverse gastrointestinal symptoms 
      compared with placebo. Although there were no differences when short-acting agents 
      were compared with each other or when long-acting agents were compared with each 
      other, dulaglutide, liraglutide and once-weekly exenatide were superior to 
      twice-daily exenatide and lixisenatide at lowering HbA1c and FPG levels. There were 
      no differences in hypoglycaemia between these 3 agents, whilst once-weekly exenatide 
      had the lowest risk of vomiting. These results, along with patient's preferences and 
      individualized targets, should be considered when selecting a GLP-1RA.

AB  - Venom research is a highly multidisciplinary field that involves multiple subfields 
      of biology, informatics, pharmacology, medicine, and other areas. These different 
      research facets are often technologically challenging and pursued by different teams 
      lacking connection with each other. This lack of coordination hampers the full 
      development of venom investigation and applications. The COST Action 
      CA19144-European Venom Network was recently launched to promote synergistic 
      interactions among different stakeholders and foster venom research at the European 
      level.

TI  - An ancient, conserved gene regulatory network led to the rise of oral venom systems.
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2021311118 [doi]
LID - e2021311118
AB  - Oral venom systems evolved multiple times in numerous vertebrates enabling the 
      exploitation of unique predatory niches. Yet how and when they evolved remains 
      poorly understood. Up to now, most research on venom evolution has focused strictly 
      on the toxins. However, using toxins present in modern day animals to trace the 
      origin of the venom system is difficult, since they tend to evolve rapidly, show 
      complex patterns of expression, and were incorporated into the venom arsenal 
      relatively recently. Here we focus on gene regulatory networks associated with the 
      production of toxins in snakes, rather than the toxins themselves. We found that 
      overall venom gland gene expression was surprisingly well conserved when compared to 
      salivary glands of other amniotes. We characterized the "metavenom network," a 
      network of ∼3,000 nonsecreted housekeeping genes that are strongly coexpressed with 
      the toxins, and are primarily involved in protein folding and modification. 
      Conserved across amniotes, this network was coopted for venom evolution by 
      exaptation of existing members and the recruitment of new toxin genes. For instance, 
      starting from this common molecular foundation, Heloderma lizards, shrews, and 
      solenodon, evolved venoms in parallel by overexpression of kallikreins, which were 
      common in ancestral saliva and induce vasodilation when injected, causing 
      circulatory shock. Derived venoms, such as those of snakes, incorporated novel 
      toxins, though still rely on hypotension for prey immobilization. These similarities 
      suggest repeated cooption of shared molecular machinery for the evolution of oral 
      venom in mammals and reptiles, blurring the line between truly venomous animals and 
      their ancestors.

TI  - Convergent evolution of venom gland transcriptomes across Metazoa.
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2111392119 [doi]
LID - e2111392119
AB  - Animals have repeatedly evolved specialized organs and anatomical structures to 
      produce and deliver a mixture of potent bioactive molecules to subdue prey or 
      predators-venom. This makes it one of the most widespread, convergent functions in 
      the animal kingdom. Whether animals have adopted the same genetic toolkit to evolved 
      venom systems is a fascinating question that still eludes us. Here, we performed a 
      comparative analysis of venom gland transcriptomes from 20 venomous species spanning 
      the main Metazoan lineages to test whether different animals have independently 
      adopted similar molecular mechanisms to perform the same function. We found a strong 
      convergence in gene expression profiles, with venom glands being more similar to 
      each other than to any other tissue from the same species, and their differences 
      closely mirroring the species phylogeny. Although venom glands secrete some of the 
      fastest evolving molecules (toxins), their gene expression does not evolve faster 
      than evolutionarily older tissues. We found 15 venom gland-specific gene modules 
      enriched in endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded protein response pathways, 
      indicating that animals have independently adopted stress response mechanisms to 
      cope with mass production of toxins. This, in turn, activates regulatory networks 
      for epithelial development, cell turnover, and maintenance, which seem composed of 
      both convergent and lineage-specific factors, possibly reflecting the different 
      developmental origins of venom glands. This study represents a first step toward an 
      understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the repeated evolution of one 
      of the most successful adaptive traits in the animal kingdom.

AB  - In general, clinical research network capacity building refers to programs aimed at 
      enhancing networks of researchers to conduct clinical research. Although in the 
      literature there is a large body of research on how to develop and build capacity in 
      clinical research networks, the conceptualizations and implementations remain 
      controversial and challenging. Moreover, the experiences learnt from the past 
      accomplishments and failures can assist in the future capacity building efforts to 
      be more practical, effective and efficient. In this paper, we aim to provide an 
      overview of capacity building in clinical research network by (1) identifying the 
      key barriers to clinical research network capacity building, (2) providing insights 
      into how to overcome those obstacles, and (3) sharing our experiences in 
      collaborating with national and international partners to build capacity in clinical 
      research networks. In conclusion, we have provided some insight into how to address 
      the key factors of clinical research network capacity building and shared some 
      empirical experiences. A successful capacity building practice requires a joint 
      endeavor to procure sufficient resources and support from the relevant stakeholders, 
      to ensure its efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability.

TI  - Snake Venom Components: Tools and Cures to Target Cardiovascular Diseases.
LID - 10.3390/molecules26082223 [doi]

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are considered as a major cause of death worldwide. 
      Therefore, identifying and developing therapeutic strategies to treat and reduce the 
      prevalence of CVDs is a major medical challenge. Several drugs used for the 
      treatment of CVDs, such as captopril, emerged from natural products, namely snake 
      venoms. These venoms are complex mixtures of bioactive molecules, which, among other 
      physiological networks, target the cardiovascular system, leading to them being 
      considered in the development and design of new drugs. In this review, we describe 
      some snake venom molecules targeting the cardiovascular system such as phospholipase 
      A2 (PLA2), natriuretic peptides (NPs), bradykinin-potentiating peptides (BPPs), 
      cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISPs), disintegrins, fibrinolytic enzymes, and 
      three-finger toxins (3FTXs). In addition, their molecular targets, and mechanisms of 
      action-vasorelaxation, inhibition of platelet aggregation, cardioprotective 
      activities-are discussed. The dissection of their biological effects at the 
      molecular scale give insights for the development of future snake venom-derived 
      drugs.

AB  - Venoms are produced by a wide variety of species including spiders, scorpions, 
      reptiles, cnidarians, and fish for the purpose of harming or incapacitating 
      predators or prey. While some venoms are of relatively simple composition, many 
      contain hundreds to thousands of individual components with distinct pharmacological 
      activity. Pain-inducing or "algesic" venom compounds have proven invaluable to our 
      understanding of how physiological nociceptive neural networks operate. In this 
      review, we present an overview of some of the diverse nociceptive pathways that can 
      be modulated by specific venom components to evoke pain.

TI  - Effect of Vipera ammodytes ammodytes Snake Venom on the Human Cytokine Network.
LID - 10.3390/toxins10070259 [doi]
LID - 259
AB  - Local inflammation is a well-known symptom of envenomation by snakes of the family 
      Viperidae, attributed primarily to the phospholipase A₂s, metalloproteinases and 
      L-amino acid oxidases contained in their venom. The inflammatory effect of snake 
      venoms has been associated with a marked increase of the cytokines IL-1&beta;, IL-6, 
      IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-&alpha;. To determine the impact of Vipera ammodytes ammodytes 
      snake venom on the expression of inflammation-related genes, we incubated human U937 
      monocyte cells with dilutions of snake venom. Gene expression was quantified for 28 
      different genes using a TaqMan(&reg;) Array Human Cytokine Network 96-well Plate in 
      a RT-qPCR system. Our results have demonstrated that 1.0 &mu;g/mL Vipera ammodytes 
      ammodytes venom solution induces a notable change in the expression of several 
      cytokine network genes. Among the upregulated genes, there were several that encode 
      interleukins, interferons, and tumor necrosis factors. We further report the 
      downregulation of three interleukin-related genes. Our findings come as supportive 
      information for the known complex effect of snake venoms on the human cytokine 
      network. It also provides relevant new information regarding the expression of genes 
      that have not been previously associated with the effect of snake venoms.

TI  - Inflammation induced by Bothrops asper venom.
PG  - 988-97
AB  - Inflammation is a major characteristic of envenomation by snakes from viperine and 
      crotaline species. Bothrops asper snake venom elicits, among other alterations, a 
      pronounced inflammatory response at the site of injection both in humans and 
      experimental animals. This review describes the current status of our understanding 
      of the inflammatory reaction, including pain, triggered by B. asper venom. The 
      experimental studies on the action of this venom as well as the complex network of 
      chemical mediators involved are summarized. Moreover, aspects of the molecular 
      mechanisms orchestrating this important response to envenomation by B. asper are 
      presented. Considering that isolated toxins are relevant tools for understanding the 
      actions of the whole venom, studies dealing with the mechanisms of inflammatory and 
      nociceptive properties of phospholipases A2, a metalloproteinase and serine 
      proteinases isolated from B. asper venom are also described.

AB  - Nowadays, treatment with specific antivenins is considered the only cure for 
      snakebites accidents. However, access to antivenom obstructs the successful 
      implementation of the World Health Organization international guidelines. In the 
      last few years, natural organic compounds, peptides, and proteins with the ability 
      to inhibit snake toxins and obtained from different sources such as plant extracts 
      and animal blood have been proposed as antivenoms. In this work, we will focus on 
      the inhibitors of the main venom toxins, phospholipases A2 and metalloproteinases, 
      and their application as novel antivenoms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anaphylaxis in children and adolescents is a potentially 
      life-threatening condition. Its heterogeneous clinical presentation and sudden 
      occurrence in virtually any setting without warning have impeded a comprehensive 
      description. OBJECTIVE: We sought to characterize severe allergic reactions in terms 
      of elicitors, symptoms, emergency treatment, and long-term management in European 
      children and adolescents. METHODS: The European Anaphylaxis Registry recorded 
      details of anaphylaxis after referral for in-depth diagnosis and counseling to 1 of 
      90 tertiary allergy centers in 10 European countries, aiming to oversample the most 
      severe reactions. Data were retrieved from medical records by using a multilanguage 
      online form. RESULTS: Between July 2007 and March 2015, anaphylaxis was identified 
      in 1970 patients younger than 18 years. Most incidents occurred in private homes 
      (46%) and outdoors (19%). One third of the patients had experienced anaphylaxis 
      previously. Food items were the most frequent trigger (66%), followed by insect 
      venom (19%). Cow's milk and hen's egg were prevalent elicitors in the first 2 years, 
      hazelnut and cashew in preschool-aged children, and peanut at all ages. There was a 
      continuous shift from food- to insect venom- and drug-induced anaphylaxis up to age 
      10 years, and there were few changes thereafter. Vomiting and cough were prevalent 
      symptoms in the first decade of life, and subjective symptoms (nausea, throat 
      tightness, and dizziness) were prevalent later in life. Thirty percent of cases were 
      lay treated, of which 10% were treated with an epinephrine autoinjector. The 
      fraction of intramuscular epinephrine in professional emergency treatment increased 
      from 12% in 2011 to 25% in 2014. Twenty-six (1.3%) patients were either admitted to 
      the intensive care unit or had grade IV/fatal reactions. CONCLUSIONS: The European 
      Anaphylaxis Registry confirmed food as the major elicitor of anaphylaxis in 
      children, specifically hen's egg, cow's milk, and nuts. Reactions to insect venom 
      were seen more in young adulthood. Intensive care unit admissions and grade IV/fatal 
      reactions were rare. The registry will serve as a systematic foundation for a 
      continuous description of this multiform condition.

AB  - A large-scale proteomic approach was devised to advance the understanding of venom 
      composition. Bothrops jararaca venom was fractionated by OFFGEL followed by 
      chromatography, generating peptidic and proteic fractions. The latter was submitted 
      to trypsin digestion. Both fractions were separately analyzed by reversed-phase 
      nanochromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry. This strategy 
      allowed deeper and joint characterizations of the peptidome and proteome 
      (proteopeptidome) of this venom. Our results lead to the identification of 46 
      protein classes (with several uniquely assigned proteins per class) comprising eight 
      high-abundance bona fide venom components, and 38 additional classes in smaller 
      quantities. This last category included previously described B. jararaca venom 
      proteins, common Elapidae venom constituents (cobra venom factor and three-finger 
      toxin), and proteins typically encountered in lysosomes, cellular membranes and 
      blood plasma. Furthermore, this report is the most complete snake venom peptidome 
      described so far, both in number of peptides and in variety of unique proteins that 
      could have originated them. It is hypothesized that such diversity could enclose 
      cryptides, whose bioactivities would contribute to envenomation in yet undetermined 
      ways. Finally, we propose that the broad range screening of B. jararaca peptidome 
      will facilitate the discovery of bioactive molecules, eventually leading to valuable 
      therapeutical agents. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Our proteopeptidomic strategy yielded 
      unprecedented insights into the remarkable diversity of B. jararaca venom 
      composition, both at the peptide and protein levels. These results bring a 
      substantial contribution to the actual pursuit of large-scale protein-level 
      assignment in snake venomics. The detection of typical elapidic venom components, in 
      a Viperidae venom, reinforces our view that the use of this approach (hand-in-hand 
      with transcriptomic and genomic data) for venom proteomic analysis, at the 
      specimen-level, can greatly contribute for venom toxin evolution studies. 
      Furthermore, data were generated in support of a previous hypothesis that venom 
      gland secretory vesicles are specialized forms of lysosomes. Two testable hypotheses 
      also emerge from the results of this work. The first is that a 
      nucleobindin-2-derived protein could lead to prey disorientation during 
      envenomation, aiding in its capture by the snake. The other being that the venom's 
      peptidome might contain a population of cryptides, whose biological activities could 
      lead to the development of new therapeutical agents.

TI  - Characterization of New Allergens from the Venom of the European Paper Wasp Polistes 
      dominula.
LID - 10.3390/toxins13080559 [doi]
LID - 559
AB  - Discriminating Polistes dominula and Vespula spp. venom allergy is of growing 
      importance worldwide, as systemic reactions to either species' sting can lead to 
      severe outcomes. Administering the correct allergen-specific immunotherapy is 
      therefore a prerequisite to ensure the safety and health of venom-allergic patients. 
      Component-resolved diagnostics of Hymenoptera venom allergy might be improved by 
      adding additional allergens to the diagnostic allergen panel. Therefore, three 
      potential new allergens from P. dominula venom-immune responsive protein 30 (IRP30), 
      vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF C) and phospholipase A2 (PLA2)-were 
      cloned, recombinantly produced and biochemically characterized. Sera sIgE titers of 
      Hymenoptera venom-allergic patients were measured in vitro to assess the 
      allergenicity and potential cross-reactivity of the venom proteins. IRP30 and VEGF C 
      were classified as minor allergens, as sensitization rates lay around 20-40%. About 
      50% of P. dominula venom-allergic patients had measurable sIgE titers directed 
      against PLA2 from P. dominula venom. Interestingly, PLA2 was unable to activate 
      basophils of allergic patients, questioning its role in the context of clinically 
      relevant sensitization. Although the obtained results hint to a questionable benefit 
      of the characterized P. dominula venom proteins for improved diagnosis of 
      venom-allergic patients, they can contribute to a deeper understanding of the 
      molecular mechanisms of Hymenoptera venoms and to the identification of factors that 
      determine the allergenic potential of proteins.

AB  - The chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) is a widely used model in medical research 
      and fulfils the requirements laid out in the 3 R's. The CAM, contains a dense 
      network of blood vessels, essential for embryo development but also makes the chick 
      embryo an invaluable resource for the study of angiogenesis and the haemotoxicity of 
      substances. Non-neurotoxic snake venom is responsible worldwide for numerous deaths 
      but also has been found to have a vast range of medicinal benefit. This study 
      combines evaluating the time of onset and intensity of effects of three whole viper 
      venoms (Bitis aritans, Crotalus viridis, Agkistrodon contortrix) at varying 
      concentrations. They were applied onto the CAM, using the Luepke grading system as 
      one method of determining their rapid irritation potential. Regarding the principles 
      of 3 R's, this method helps to evaluate the haemotoxic effect of venom as an 
      alternative method to the rodent tests. The information provided from these results 
      can be used as a rapid tool for both medical management of snakebite wounds and the 
      potential use of snake venom in medical treatments. Then, Luepke grading system can 
      help to evaluate the haemotoxic effect of venom in combination with other 
      appropriate methods.

AB  - Although immunomodulatory property and many other pharmaceutical applications of 
      scorpion venom have been addressed before, no studies were reported about its 
      application as a neuroimmunomodulator at therapeutic dose. In this study, we 
      conceptualized the property of scorpion venom, capable of inducing the acute pain 
      and neurotoxicity can cause acute stress resulting in the modulation of immune cells 
      through HPA axis. The whole venom from Hottentotta rugiscutis, a widely seen 
      scorpion in the region of eastern Karnataka, was extracted and injected a single 
      dose of 1 mg/kg b.w. to Swiss albino mice and then erythrocytes and leukogram were 
      measured. Whole brain AChE activity, corticosterone, cytokines and NO levels in 
      plasma were also evaluated at various time points. Hrv didn't show any 
      histopathological changes in the lymphoid organs and at the site of injection. 
      However, lymphocytes and neutrophils did get altered at 2 h post-injection. Plasma 
      corticosterone, cytokine levels such as IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α and IL-10 and the AChE 
      activity were significantly increased in a time-dependent manner. Based on these 
      results, it may be predicted, Hrv's ability to cause acute stress resulted in the 
      activation of HPA axis, which stimulates the release of glucocorticoid hormones 
      which in turn elicits the immunomodulation of leukocytes by altering the levels of 
      pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, we can conclude, the impact of acute 
      stress induced by Hrv can intercommunicate the signals between neuroendocrine-immune 
      systems.

TI  - Venom immunotherapy in patients with mastocytosis and hymenoptera venom anaphylaxis.
PG  - 637-51
LID - 10.2217/imt.11.44 [doi]
AB  - Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is typically suspected in patients with cutaneous 
      mastocytosis (CM). In recent years, the presence of clonal mast cells (MCs) in a 
      subset of patients with systemic symptoms associated with MC activation in the 
      absence of CM has been reported and termed monoclonal MC activation syndromes or 
      clonal systemic MC activation syndromes. In these cases, bone marrow (BM) MC numbers 
      are usually lower than in SM with CM, there are no detectable BM MC aggregates, and 
      serum baseline tryptase is often <20 µg/l; thus, diagnosis of SM in these patients 
      should be based on careful evaluation of other minor WHO criteria for SM in 
      reference centers, where highly sensitive techniques for immunophenotypic analysis 
      and investigation of KIT mutations on fluorescence-activated cell sorter-purified BM 
      MCs are routinely performed. The prevalence of hymenoptera venom anaphylaxis (HVA) 
      among SM patients is higher than among the normal population and it has been 
      reported to be approximately 5%. In SM patients with IgE-mediated HVA, venom 
      immunotherapy is safe and effective and it should be prescribed lifelong. Severe 
      adverse reactions to hymenoptera stings or venom immunotherapy have been associated 
      with increased serum baseline tryptase; however, presence of clonal MC has not been 
      ruled out in most reports and thus both SM and clonal MC activation syndrome might 
      be underdiagnosed in such patients. In fact, clonal BM MC appears to be a relevant 
      risk factor for both HVA and severe reactions to venom immunotherapy, while the 
      increase in serum baseline tryptase by itself should be considered as a powerful 
      surrogate marker for anaphylaxis. The Spanish Network on Mastocytosis has developed 
      a scoring system based on patient gender, the clinical symptoms observed during 
      anaphylaxis and serum baseline tryptase to predict for the presence of both MC 
      clonality and SM among individuals who suffer from anaphylaxis.

TI  - Olfactory Dysfunction Mediates Adiposity in Cognitive Impairment of Type 2 Diabetes: 
      Insights From Clinical and Functional Neuroimaging Studies.
PG  - 1274-1283
LID - 10.2337/dc18-2584 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Large numbers of people with type 2 diabetes are obese. However, changes 
      in cognition and related brain function in obese people with diabetes have not been 
      characterized. Here, we investigated cognition, olfactory function, and odor-induced 
      brain alterations in these patients and therapeutic effects of glucagon-like peptide 
      1 receptor agonists (GLP-1Ras) on their psychological behavior and olfactory 
      networks. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Cognitive, olfactory, and odor-induced brain 
      activation assessments were administered to 35 obese and 35 nonobese people with 
      type 2 diabetes and 35 control subjects matched for age, sex, and education. Among 
      them, 20 obese individuals with diabetes with inadequate glycemic control and 
      metformin monotherapy received GLP-1Ra treatment for 3 months and were reassessed 
      for metabolic, cognitive, olfactory, and neuroimaging changes. RESULTS: Obese 
      subjects with diabetes demonstrated lower general cognition and olfactory threshold 
      scores, decreased left hippocampal activation, and disrupted seed-based functional 
      connectivity with right insula compared with nonobese subjects with diabetes. 
      Negative associations were found between adiposity and episodic memory and between 
      fasting insulin and processing speed test time in diabetes. Mediation analyses 
      showed that olfactory function and left hippocampus activation mediated these 
      correlations. With 3-month GLP-1Ra treatment, obese subjects with diabetes exhibited 
      improved Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score, olfactory test total score, and 
      enhanced odor-induced right parahippocampus activation. CONCLUSIONS: Obese subjects 
      with type 2 diabetes showed impaired cognition and dysfunctional olfaction and brain 
      networks, the latter of which mediated adiposity in cognitive impairment of 
      diabetes. GLP-1Ras ameliorated cognitive and olfactory abnormalities in obese 
      subjects with diabetes, providing new perspectives for early diagnosis and 
      therapeutic approaches for cognitive decrements in these patients.

      Understanding.

LID - 93
AB  - The historical development of discoveries and conceptual frames for understanding 
      the hemorrhagic activity induced by viperid snake venoms and by hemorrhagic 
      metalloproteinases (SVMPs) present in these venoms is reviewed. Histological and 
      ultrastructural tools allowed the identification of the capillary network as the 
      main site of action of SVMPs. After years of debate, biochemical developments 
      demonstrated that all hemorrhagic toxins in viperid venoms are zinc-dependent 
      metalloproteinases. Hemorrhagic SVMPs act by initially hydrolyzing key substrates at 
      the basement membrane (BM) of capillaries. This degradation results in the weakening 
      of the mechanical stability of the capillary wall, which becomes distended owing of 
      the action of the hemodynamic biophysical forces operating in the circulation. As a 
      consequence, the capillary wall is disrupted and extravasation occurs. SVMPs do not 
      induce rapid toxicity to endothelial cells, and the pathological effects described 
      in these cells in vivo result from the mechanical action of these hemodynamic 
      forces. Experimental evidence suggests that degradation of type IV collagen, and 
      perhaps also perlecan, is the key event in the onset of microvessel damage. It is 
      necessary to study this phenomenon from a holistic, systemic perspective in which 
      the action of other venom components is also taken into consideration.

AB  - Variation in gene regulation is ubiquitous, yet identifying the mechanisms producing 
      such variation, especially for complex traits, is challenging. Snake venoms provide 
      a model system for studying the phenotypic impacts of regulatory variation in 
      complex traits because of their genetic tractability. Here, we sequence the genome 
      of the Tiger Rattlesnake, which possesses the simplest and most toxic venom of any 
      rattlesnake species, to determine whether the simple venom phenotype is the result 
      of a simple genotype through gene loss or a complex genotype mediated through 
      regulatory mechanisms. We generate the most contiguous snake-genome assembly to date 
      and use this genome to show that gene loss, chromatin accessibility, and methylation 
      levels all contribute to the production of the simplest, most toxic rattlesnake 
      venom. We provide the most complete characterization of the venom gene-regulatory 
      network to date and identify key mechanisms mediating phenotypic variation across a 
      polygenic regulatory network.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Snakebites remain a major life-threatening event worldwide. It is still 
      difficult to make a positive identification of snake species by clinicians in both 
      Western medicine and Chinese medicine. The main reason for this is a shortage of 
      diagnostic biomarkers and lack of knowledge about pathways of venom-induced 
      toxicity. In traditional Chinese medicine, snakebites are considered to be treated 
      with wind, fire, and wind-fire toxin, but additional studies are required. METHODS: 
      Cases of snakebite seen at the Affiliated Hospital of Jiangxi University of 
      Traditional Chinese Medicine were grouped as follows: fire toxin - including four 
      cases of bites by Agkistrodon acutus and three bites by Trimeresurus stejnegeri - 
      and wind-fire toxin - four cases of bites by vipers and three bites by cobras. Serum 
      protein quantification was performed using LC-MS/MS. Differential abundance proteins 
      (DAPs) were identified from comparison of snakebites of each snake species and 
      healthy controls. The protein interaction network was constructed using STITCH 
      database. RESULTS: Principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering of 474 
      unique proteins exhibited protein expression profiles of wind-fire toxins that are 
      distinct from that of fire toxins. Ninety-three DAPs were identified in each 
      snakebite subgroup as compared with healthy control, of which 38 proteins were found 
      to have significantly different expression levels and 55 proteins displayed no 
      expression in one subgroup, by subgroup comparison. GO analysis revealed that the 
      DAPs participated in bicarbonate/oxygen transport and hydrogen peroxide catabolic 
      process, and affected carbon-oxygen lyase activity and heme binding. Thirty DAPs 
      directly or indirectly acted on hydrogen peroxide in the interaction network of 
      proteins and drug compounds. The network was clustered into four groups: lipid 
      metabolism and transport; IGF-mediated growth; oxygen transport; and innate 
      immunity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the pathways of snake venom-induced 
      toxicity may form a protein network of antioxidant defense by regulating oxidative 
      stress through interaction with hydrogen peroxide.

TI  - Snake venom phospholipases A(2): a novel tool against bacterial diseases.
PG  - 6150-62
AB  - The majority of snake venom phospholipases A(2) (svPLA(2)s) are toxic and induce a 
      wide spectrum of biological effects. They are cysteine-rich proteins that contain 
      119-134 amino acids and share similar structures and functions. About 50% of the 
      residues are incorporated into α-helices, whereas only 10% are in β-sheets. Fourteen 
      conserved cysteines form a network of seven disulfide bridges that stabilize the 
      tertiary structure. They show a high degree of sequence and structural similarity, 
      and are believed to have a common calcium- dependent catalytic mechanism. 
      Additionally, svPLA(2)s display an array of biological actions that are either 
      dependent or independent of catalysis. The PLA(2)s of mammalian origin also exert 
      potent bactericidal activity by binding to anionic surfaces and enzymatic 
      degradation of phospholipids in the target membranes, preferentially of 
      Gram-positive species. The bactericidal activity against Gram-negatives by svPLA(2) 
      requires a synergistic action with bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein 
      (BPI), but is equally dependent on enzymatic- based membrane degradation. Several 
      hypotheses account for the bactericidal properties of svPLA(2)s, which include 
      "fatal depolarization" of the bacterial membrane, creation of physical holes in the 
      membrane, scrambling of normal distribution of lipids between the bilayer leaflets, 
      and damage of critical intracellular targets after internalization of the peptide. 
      The present review discusses several svPLA(2)s and derived peptides that exhibit 
      strong bactericidal activity. The reports demonstrate that svPLA(2)-derived peptides 
      have the potential to counteract microbial infections. In fact, the C-terminal 
      cationic/hydrophobic segment (residues 115-129) of svPLA(2)s is bactericidal. Thus 
      identification of the bactericidal sites in svPLA(2)s has potential for developing 
      novel antimicrobials.

TI  - Hexapod Assassins' Potion: Venom Composition and Bioactivity from the Eurasian 
      Assassin Bug Rhynocoris iracundus.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines9070819 [doi]
LID - 819
AB  - Assassin bug venoms are potent and exert diverse biological functions, making them 
      potential biomedical goldmines. Besides feeding functions on arthropods, assassin 
      bugs also use their venom for defense purposes causing localized and systemic 
      reactions in vertebrates. However, assassin bug venoms remain poorly characterized. 
      We collected the venom from the assassin bug Rhynocoris iracundus and investigated 
      its composition and bioactivity in vitro and in vivo. It caused lysis of murine 
      neuroblastoma, hepatoma cells, and healthy murine myoblasts. We demonstrated, for 
      the first time, that assassin bug venom induces neurolysis and suggest that it 
      counteracts paralysis locally via the destruction of neural networks, contributing 
      to tissue digestion. Furthermore, the venom caused paralysis and melanization of 
      Galleria mellonella larvae and pupae, whilst also possessing specific antibacterial 
      activity against Escherichia coli, but not Listeria grayi and Pseudomonas 
      aeruginosa. A combinatorial proteo-transcriptomic approach was performed to identify 
      potential toxins responsible for the observed effects. We identified neurotoxic 
      Ptu1, an inhibitory cystin knot (ICK) toxin homologous to ω-conotoxins from cone 
      snails, cytolytic redulysins homologous to trialysins from hematophagous kissing 
      bugs, and pore-forming hemolysins. Additionally, chitinases and kininogens were 
      found and may be responsible for insecticidal and cytolytic activities. We 
      demonstrate the multifunctionality and complexity of assassin bug venom, which 
      renders its molecular components interesting for potential biomedical applications.

LID - 10.1200/JCO.18.01567 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Opioids are the primary choice for managing chronic cancer pain. However, 
      many nonopioid therapies are currently prescribed for chronic cancer pain with 
      little published evidence comparing their efficacy. METHODS: Electronic databases 
      were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any systemic 
      pharmaceutical intervention and/or combination thereof in treating chronic cancer 
      pain. The primary outcome was global efficacy reported as an odds ratio (OR). The 
      secondary outcome was change in pain intensity reported as a standardized mean 
      difference (SMD). RESULTS: We included 81 RCTs consisting of 10,003 patients 
      investigating 11 medication classes. Most RCTs (80%) displayed low risk of bias. The 
      top-ranking classes for global efficacy were nonopioid analgesics (network OR, 0.30; 
      95% credibility interval [CrI], 0.13 to 0.67), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
      (network OR, 0.44; 95% CrI, 0.22 to 0.90), and opioids (network OR, 0.49; 95% CrI, 
      0.27 to 0.86), whereas the top-ranked interventions were lidocaine (network OR, 
      0.04; 95% CrI, 0.01 to 0.18; surface under the cumulative ranking curve analysis 
      [SUCRA] score, 98.1), codeine plus aspirin (network OR, 0.22; 95% CrI, 0.08 to 0.63; 
      SUCRA score, 81.1), and pregabalin (network OR, 0.29; 95% CrI, 0.08 to 0.92; SUCRA 
      score, 73.8). In terms of reducing pain intensity, we found that no class was 
      superior to placebo, whereas the following top-ranked interventions were superior to 
      placebo: ziconotide (network SMD, -24.98; 95% CrI, -32.62 to -17.35; SUCRA score, 
      99.8), dezocine (network SMD, -13.56; 95% CrI, -23.37 to -3.69; SUCRA score, 93.5), 
      and diclofenac (network SMD, -11.22; 95% CrI, -15.91 to -5.80; SUCRA score, 92.9). 
      CONCLUSION: There are significant differences in efficacy among current regimens for 
      chronic cancer pain. Our evidence suggests that certain nonopioid analgesics and 
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can serve as effectively as opioids in managing 
      chronic cancer pain.

TI  - Symbiotic polydnavirus and venom reveal parasitoid to its hyperparasitoids.
PG  - 5205-5210
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1717904115 [doi]
AB  - Symbiotic relationships may provide organisms with key innovations that aid in the 
      establishment of new niches. For example, during oviposition, some species of 
      parasitoid wasps, whose larvae develop inside the bodies of other insects, inject 
      polydnaviruses into their hosts. These symbiotic viruses disrupt host immune 
      responses, allowing the parasitoid's progeny to survive. Here we show that symbiotic 
      polydnaviruses also have a downside to the parasitoid's progeny by initiating a 
      multitrophic chain of interactions that reveals the parasitoid larvae to their 
      enemies. These enemies are hyperparasitoids that use the parasitoid progeny as host 
      for their own offspring. We found that the virus and venom injected by the 
      parasitoid during oviposition, but not the parasitoid progeny itself, affected 
      hyperparasitoid attraction toward plant volatiles induced by feeding of parasitized 
      caterpillars. We identified activity of virus-related genes in the caterpillar 
      salivary gland. Moreover, the virus affected the activity of elicitors of salivary 
      origin that induce plant responses to caterpillar feeding. The changes in 
      caterpillar saliva were critical in inducing plant volatiles that are used by 
      hyperparasitoids to locate parasitized caterpillars. Our results show that symbiotic 
      organisms may be key drivers of multitrophic ecological interactions. We anticipate 
      that this phenomenon is widespread in nature, because of the abundance of symbiotic 
      microorganisms across trophic levels in ecological communities. Their role should be 
      more prominently integrated in community ecology to understand organization of 
      natural and managed ecosystems, as well as adaptations of individual organisms that 
      are part of these communities.

AB  - Aiming at the problems of the wet experiment method in identifying the types of 
      conotoxins, such as the complexity, low efficiency and high cost, this study 
      proposes a method that uses the sequence information of the conotoxin peptides 
      combined with long short term memory networks (LSTM) models to predict the Methods 
      of spirotoxin category. This method only needs to take the conotoxin peptide 
      sequence as input, and adopts the character embedding method in text processing to 
      automatically map the sequence to the feature vector representation, and the model 
      extracts features for training and prediction. Experimental results show that the 
      correct index of this method on the test set reaches 0.80, and the AUC value reaches 
      0.817. For the same test set, the AUC value of the KNN algorithm is 0.641, and the 
      AUC value of the method proposed in this paper is 0.817, indicating that this method 
      can effectively assist in identifying the type of conotoxin.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To update the influence of the global climate change on 
      Hymenoptera venom allergy. RECENT FINDINGS: Climate change facilitates biological 
      invasions of hymenopteran species and plays a role in the impact of introduced 
      species relevant for human health. It contributes to a rise in the incidence of 
      sting injuries and allergy reactions across the world. SUMMARY: Global climate 
      change has contributed to the expansion and the redistribution of allergenic insect 
      species, increasing the number of allergy cases caused by stinging insects 
      worldwide. Imported insects are trending species in systemic reactions for multiple 
      stings or hymenopteran venom allergy. They represent a threat for humans and a 
      challenge for the allergists.

LID - 10.1016/j.semcancer.2020.05.006 [doi]
AB  - Cancer cells exhibit molecular characteristics that confer them different 
      proliferative capacities and survival advantages to adapt to stress conditions, such 
      as deregulation of cellular bioenergetics, genomic instability, ability to promote 
      angiogenesis, invasion, cell dormancy, immune evasion, and cell death resistance. In 
      addition to these hallmarks of cancer, the current cytostatic drugs target the 
      proliferation of malignant cells, being ineffective in metastatic disease. These 
      aspects highlight the need to identify promising therapeutic targets for new 
      generations of anti-cancer drugs. Toxins isolated from snake venoms are a natural 
      source of useful molecular scaffolds to obtain agents with a selective effect on 
      cancer cells. In this article, we discuss the recent advances in the molecular 
      mechanisms of nine classes of snake toxins that suppress the hallmarks of cancer by 
      induction of oxidative phosphorylation dysfunction, reactive oxygen 
      species-dependent DNA damage, blockage of extracellular matrix-integrin signaling, 
      disruption of cytoskeleton network and inhibition of growth factor-dependent 
      signaling. The possible therapeutic implications of toxin-based anti-cancer drug 
      development are also highlighted.

TI  - Black Widow Spider Toxicity.
BTI - StatPearls
AB  - The black widow spider species, also known by its biological nomenclature as 
      the Latrodectus species is one of more than 40,000 different species of spiders. 
      Clinically, it is one of most significant species of spiders worldwide. Within the 
      United States, it is responsible for most of the clinically significant envenomation 
      among all species of spiders. There are more than 30 different types of black widow 
      spiders worldwide; however, not all species are as relevant due to their separation 
      from human habitat. The genus Latrodectus derives its ubiquitous nickname “black 
      widow” from its physical characteristics. The Black Widow, or Latrodectus 
      mactans, is easily identified by its characteristic shiny black body and strikingly 
      red hourglass-shaped marking on the abdomen. Interestingly, this species is well 
      known by the phenomenon of the female spider devouring the male spider after mating, 
      thereby making her a widow. Black widow spiders range from 5 to 15 mm (0.25 to 0.50 
      inch) in length. They have fangs and venomous glands sufficient to cause harm to 
      humans. The female gender of the species is the most dangerous, compared to their 
      male counterparts.  Females have more prominent venomous glands, longer fangs and a 
      body size that can reach up to 20-times larger than their male counterparts. 
      Symptoms of envenomation range from local irritation and pain to a more systemic 
      syndrome termed “latrodectism.” Latrodectism is characterized by variations in 
      presentations ranging from autonomic disturbances to widespread pain and rigidity. 
      Treatment ranges from simple analgesia to the administration of antivenom.

      of Medically-Important Cryptic Kraits in India.
LID - 10.3390/toxins13010069 [doi]
LID - 69
AB  - The Common Krait (Bungarus caeruleus) shares a distribution range with many other 
      'phenotypically-similar' kraits across the Indian subcontinent. Despite several 
      reports of fatal envenomings by other Bungarus species, commercial Indian antivenoms 
      are only manufactured against B. caeruleus. It is, therefore, imperative to 
      understand the distribution of genetically distinct lineages of kraits, the 
      compositional differences in their venoms, and the consequent impact of venom 
      variation on the (pre)clinical effectiveness of antivenom therapy. To address this 
      knowledge gap, we conducted phylogenetic and comparative venomics investigations of 
      kraits in Southern and Western India. Phylogenetic reconstructions using 
      mitochondrial markers revealed a new species of krait, Romulus' krait (Bungarus 
      romulusi sp. nov.), in Southern India. Additionally, we found that kraits with 17 
      mid-body dorsal scale rows in Western India do not represent a subspecies of the 
      Sind Krait (B. sindanus walli) as previously believed, but are genetically very 
      similar to B. sindanus in Pakistan. Furthermore, venom proteomics and comparative 
      transcriptomics revealed completely contrasting venom profiles. While the venom 
      gland transcriptomes of all three species were highly similar, venom proteomes and 
      toxicity profiles differed significantly, suggesting the prominent role of 
      post-genomic regulatory mechanisms in shaping the venoms of these cryptic kraits. In 
      vitro venom recognition and in vivo neutralisation experiments revealed a strong 
      negative impact of venom variability on the preclinical performance of commercial 
      antivenoms. While the venom of B. caeruleus was neutralised as per the 
      manufacturer's claim, performance against the venoms of B. sindanus and B. romulusi 
      was poor, highlighting the need for regionally-effective antivenoms in India.

AB  - In the era of Next-Generation Sequencing and shotgun proteomics, the sequences of 
      animal toxigenic proteins are being generated at rates exceeding the pace of 
      traditional means for empirical toxicity verification. To facilitate the automation 
      of toxin identification from protein sequences, we trained Recurrent Neural Networks 
      with Gated Recurrent Units on publicly available datasets. The resulting models are 
      available via the novel software package TOXIFY, allowing users to infer the 
      probability of a given protein sequence being a venom protein. TOXIFY is more than 
      20X faster and uses over an order of magnitude less memory than previously published 
      methods. Additionally, TOXIFY is more accurate, precise, and sensitive at 
      classifying venom proteins.

AB  - A thrombin-like enzyme, pictobin, was purified from Bothrops pictus snake venom. It 
      is a 41-kDa monomeric glycoprotein as showed by mass spectrometry and contains 
      approx. 45% carbohydrate by mass which could be removed with N-glycosidase. Pictobin 
      coagulates plasma and fibrinogen, releasing fibrinopeptide A and induces the 
      formation of a friable/porous fibrin network as visualized by SEM. The enzyme 
      promoted platelet aggregation in human PRP and defibrination in mouse model and 
      showed catalytic activity on chromogenic substrates S-2266, S-2366, S-2160 and 
      S-2238. Pictobin interacts with the plasma inhibitor α2-macroglobulin, which blocks 
      its interaction with fibrinogen but not with the small substrate BApNA. Heparin does 
      not affect its enzymatic activity. Pictobin cross reacted with polyvalent bothropic 
      antivenom, and its deglycosylated form reduced its catalytic action and antivenom 
      reaction. In breast and lung cancer cells, pictobin inhibits the 
      fibronectin-stimulated migration. Moreover, it produces strong NADH oxidation, 
      mitochondrial depolarization, ATP decrease and fragmentation of mitochondrial 
      network. These results suggest by first time that a snake venom serinprotease 
      produces mitochondrial dysfunction by affecting mitochondrial dynamics and 
      bioenergetics. Structural model of pictobin reveals a conserved chymotrypsin fold 
      β/β hydrolase. These data indicate that pictobin has therapeutic potential in the 
      treatment of cardiovascular disorders and metastatic disease.

TI  - A network meta-analysis to compare glycaemic control in patients with type 2

AB  - AIMS: The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) exenatide once 
      weekly (ExQW) and liraglutide once daily (QD) are indicated to improve glycaemic 
      control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Although glycaemic control with ExQW 
      versus liraglutide QD 1.8 mg has been directly compared, no studies have compared 
      ExQW with liraglutide QD 1.2 mg or determined the probable relative efficacies of 
      various injectable therapies for glycaemic control; therefore, a network 
      meta-analysis was performed to address these questions. METHODS: A systematic review 
      identified randomized controlled trials of ≥24 weeks that compared ExQW, liraglutide 
      QD (1.2 mg, 1.8 mg), insulin glargine, exenatide twice daily (ExBID), or placebo. 
      Twenty-two studies evaluating 11 049 patients were included in the network 
      meta-analysis. Mean differences in HbA1c relative to placebo or each other and 
      probability rankings were estimated. RESULTS: Estimated mean differences in HbA1c 
      versus placebo were -1.15% (95% CrI: -1.31 to -1.00) for ExQW, -1.01% (95% CrI: 
      -1.18 to -0.85) for liraglutide 1.2 mg, and -1.18% (95% CrI: -1.32 to -1.04) for 
      liraglutide 1.8 mg. HbA1c differences for ExQW versus liraglutide 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg 
      were -0.14% (95% CrI: -0.34 to 0.06) and 0.03% (95% CrI: -0.14 to 0.18), 
      respectively. The estimated mean difference in HbA1c between liraglutide 1.2 mg and 
      1.8 mg was 0.17% (95% CrI: 0.02-0.30). Results were consistent when adjusted for 
      background antihyperglycaemic medications and diabetes duration. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      network meta-analysis did not identify meaningful differences in HbA1c lowering 
      between ExQW and both liraglutide doses, suggesting that these GLP-1 RAs have 
      similar glycaemic effects.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Toad venom is one of widely used traditional Chinese 
      medicines due to its analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities. However, 
      hydrophilic alkaloids from toad venom, which may have certain pharmacological 
      activities, have not been systematic studied. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the study 
      was to identify the indolealkylamines (IAAs) from toad venom and investigate the 
      analgesic and anti-inflammatory actions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The alkaloids were 
      extracted and identified by high-resolution mass spectrometry. The analgesic 
      abilities were determined using hot-plate test, formalin test and von Frey test. 
      High-sensitivity lipidomics was used to investigate the regulatory function of IAAs 
      on inflammatory eicosanoids. Besides, network pharmacology and molecular docking 
      were used to demonstrate the candidate targets of IAAs. RESULTS: 22 constituents 
      have been characterized by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-Triple TOF 
      5600, including six specific IAAs (serotonin, N-methyl serotonin, bufotenine, 
      bufotenidine, bufothionine and dehydrobufotenine). Pharmacological studies showed 
      that the IAAs from toad venom exerted significant analgesic activities at doses of 
      5, 15 and 45 mg/kg in vivo. Moreover, lipids analysis revealed IAAs might 
      down-regulate inflammatory mediators from COX, LOX, DHA and LA pathways in formalin 
      models, thus showing anti-inflammatory effect. The potent pharmacological function 
      might because of the binding of IAAs and protein targets, such as sigma-1 receptor. 
      CONCLUSION: The studies provided a systemic evidence for the analgesic and 
      anti-inflammatory activities of IAAs from toad venom. It suggested that IAAs might 
      be a potential candidate to reduce inflammatory pain disorders.

TI  - Venom apparatus of the Brazilian tarantula Vitalius dubius Mello-Leitão 1923

AB  - Tarantula venoms are a cocktail of proteins and peptides that have been increasingly 
      studied in recent years. In contrast, less attention has been given to analyzing the 
      structure of the paired cephalic glands that produce the venom. We have used light, 
      electron, and confocal microscopy to study the organization and structure of the 
      venom gland of the Brazilian tarantula Vitalius dubius. The chelicerae are hairy 
      chitinous structures, each with a single curved hollow fang that opens via an 
      orifice on the anterior surface. Internally, each chelicera contains striated muscle 
      fiber bundles that control fang extension and retraction, and a cylindrical conical 
      venom gland surrounded by a thick well-developed layer of obliquely arranged muscle 
      fibers. Light microscopy of longitudinal and transverse sections showed that the 
      gland secretory epithelium consists of a sponge-like network of slender epithelial 
      cell processes with numerous bridges and interconnections that form lacunae 
      containing secretion. This secretory epithelium is supported by a basement membrane 
      containing elastic fibers. The entire epithelial structure of the venom-secreting 
      cells is reinforced by a dense network of F-actin intermediate filaments, as shown 
      by staining with phalloidin. Neural elements (axons and acetylcholinesterase 
      activity) are also associated with the venom gland. Transmission electron microscopy 
      of the epithelium revealed an ultrastructure typical of secretory cells, including 
      abundant rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, an extensive Golgi apparatus, and 
      numerous mitochondria.

TI  - Phenotype and risk factors of venom-induced anaphylaxis: A case-control study of the 
      European Anaphylaxis Registry.
PG  - 653-662.e9
LID - S0091-6749(20)30838-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jaci.2020.06.008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Venom-induced anaphylaxis (VIA) is a common, potentially 
      life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction associated with (1) a specific symptom 
      profile, 2) specific cofactors, and 3) specific management. Identifying the 
      differences in phenotypes of anaphylaxis is crucial for future management guidelines 
      and development of a personalized medicine approach. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to 
      evaluate the phenotype and risk factors of VIA. METHODS: Using data from the 
      European Anaphylaxis Registry (12,874 cases), we identified 3,612 patients with VIA 
      and analyzed their cases in comparison with sex- and age-matched anaphylaxis cases 
      triggered by other elicitors (non-VIA cases [n = 3,605]). RESULTS: VIA more 
      frequently involved more than 3 organ systems and was associated with cardiovascular 
      symptoms. The absence of skin symptoms during anaphylaxis was correlated with 
      baseline serum tryptase level and was associated with an increased risk of a severe 
      reaction. Intramuscular or intravenous epinephrine was administered significantly 
      less often in VIA, in particular, in patients without a history of anaphylaxis. 
      A baseline serum tryptase level within the upper normal range (8-11.5 ng/mL) was 
      more frequently associated with severe anaphylaxis. CONCLUSION: Using a large cohort 
      of VIA cases, we have validated that patients with intermediate baseline serum 
      tryptase levels (8-11 ng/mL) and without skin involvement have a higher risk of 
      severe VIA. Patients receiving β-blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme 
      inhibitors had a higher risk of developing severe cardiovascular symptoms (including 
      cardiac arrest) in VIA and non-VIA cases. Patients experiencing VIA received 
      epinephrine less frequently than did cases with non-VIA.

TI  - Venom and Dufour's glands of the emerald cockroach wasp Ampulex compressa (Insecta,

AB  - The digger wasp species Ampulex compressa produces its venom in two branched gland 
      tubules. They terminate in a short common duct, which is bifurcated at its proximal 
      end. One leg is linked with the venom reservoir, the other one extends to the ductus 
      venatus. Each venom gland tubule possesses, over its entire length, a cuticle-lined 
      central duct. Around this duct densely packed class 3 gland units each composed of a 
      secretory cell and a canal cell are arranged. The position of their nuclei was 
      demonstrated by DAPI staining. The brush border of the secretory cells surrounds the 
      coiled end-apparatus. Venom is stored in a bladder like reservoir, which is 
      surrounded by a thin reticulated layer of muscle fibres. The reservoir as a whole is 
      lined with class 3 gland units. The tubiform Dufour's gland has a length of about 
      350 μm (∅ 125 μm) only and is surrounded by a network of pronounced striated muscle 
      fibres. The glandular epithelium is mono-layered belonging to the class 1 type of 
      insect epidermal glands. The gland cells are characterized by conspicuous lipid 
      vesicles. Secretion of material via the gland cuticle into the gland lumen is 
      apparent. Analysis of the polypeptide composition demonstrated that the free gland 
      tubules and the venom reservoir contain numerous proteins ranging from 3.4 to 
      200 kDa. The polypeptide composition of the Dufour's gland is completely different 
      and contains no lectin-binding glycoproteins, whereas a dominant component of the 
      venom droplets is a glycoprotein of about 80 kDa. Comparison of the venom reservoir 
      contents with the polypeptide pattern of venom droplets revealed that all of the 
      major proteinaceous constituents are secreted. The secreted venom contains 
      exclusively proteins present in the soluble contents of the venom gland. The most 
      abundant compound class in the Dufour's gland consisted of n-alkanes followed by 
      monomethyl-branched alkanes and alkadienes. Heptacosane was the most abundant 
      n-alkane. Furthermore, a single volatile compound, 2-methylpentan-3-one, was 
      identified in various concentrations in the lipid extract of the Dufour's gland.

TI  - The RCPCH care pathway for children with venom allergies: an evidence and consensus 
      based national approach.
PG  - i38-40
LID - 10.1136/archdischild-2011-300218 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) Science & Research 
      Department was commissioned by the Department of Health to develop national care 
      pathways for children with allergies; the venom allergy pathway is the seventh 
      pathway. The pathways focus on defining the competences to improve the equity of 
      care received by children with allergic conditions. METHOD: The RCPCH venom allergy 
      pathway was developed by a multidisciplinary working group and was based on a 
      comprehensive review of evidence. The pathway was reviewed by a broad group of 
      stakeholders including the public and approved by the Allergy Care Pathways Project 
      Board and the RCPCH Clinical Standards Committee. RESULTS: The pathway results are 
      presented in four parts: evidence review, mapping, external review and core 
      knowledge documents. The entry points are defined and the ideal pathway of care is 
      described from self-care through to follow-up. The evidence highlighted that venom 
      immunotherapy is safe and effective for bee and wasp allergy and that there are real 
      quality of life benefits for patients. The review also highlighted the value of 
      measuring serum tryptase after reactions. CONCLUSIONS: The venom allergy pathway 
      provides a guide for training and development of services to facilitate improvements 
      in delivery as close to the patient's home as possible. The authors recommend that 
      this pathway should be implemented locally by a multidisciplinary team with a focus 
      on creating networks between primary, secondary and tertiary care to improve 
      services for children with allergic conditions.

TI  - Parasitoid wasp venom vesicles (venosomes) enter Drosophila melanogaster 
      lamellocytes through a flotillin/lipid raft-dependent endocytic pathway.
PG  - 1512-1521
LID - 10.1080/21505594.2020.1838116 [doi]
AB  - Venosomes are extracellular vesicles found in the venom of Leptopilina 
      endoparasitoids wasps, which transport and target virulence factors to impair the 
      parasitoid egg encapsulation by the lamellocytes of their Drosophila melanogaster 
      host larva. Using the co-immunolocalization of fluorescent L. boulardi venosomes and 
      one of the putative-transported virulence factors, LbGAP, with known markers of 
      cellular endocytosis, we show that venosomes endocytosis by lamellocytes is not a 
      process dependent on clathrin or macropinocytosis and internalization seems to 
      bypass the early endosomal compartment Rab5. After internalization, LbGAP 
      colocalizes strongly with flotillin-1 and the GPI-anchored protein Atilla/L1 (a 
      lamellocyte surface marker) suggesting that entry occurs via a flotillin/lipid 
      raft-dependent pathway. Once internalized, venosomes reach all intracellular 
      compartments, including late and recycling endosomes, lysosomes, and the endoplasmic 
      reticulum network. Venosomes therefore enter their target cells by a specific 
      mechanism and the virulence factors are widely distributed in the lamellocytes' 
      compartments to impair their functions.

TI  - Spitting cobras: Experimental assay employing the model of chicken embryo and the 
      chick chorioallantoic membrane for imaging and evaluation of effects of venom from 
      African and Asian species (Naja ashei, Naja nigricollis, Naja siamensis, Naja 
      sumatrana).

AB  - Among the captivating world of venomous snakes, an outstanding group of cobras from 
      the family Elapidae is characterized by a distinctive structure of proteroglyphous 
      venom apparatus that allows the ejection of venom from the fangs and formation of 
      aerosol particles. The venom of "spitting" cobras is innocuous when sprayed over the 
      intact skin, but contact with the eye surface is followed by ophthalmia and a 
      temporary blindness, that may remain permanent, unless immediate and adequate 
      medical interventions are carried out. The aim of this work was to monitor and 
      evaluate induced vasoactive effects as well as embryotoxic effects with the regard 
      to the whole crude venom of four "spitting" cobra species (African species Naja 
      ashei and Naja nigricollis, Asian species Naja siamensis and Naja sumatrana). 
      Vasoactive effects were visualized using the Hen's Egg Test - Chorioallantoic 
      membrane (HET-CAM) test. The Chick Embryotoxicity Screening Test (CHEST) was used to 
      estimate embryotoxicity and the data were then processed using statistical analysis. 
      The highest embryonic mortality rate was observed after administration of venom from 
      Naja nigricollis among the whole crude venoms tested. All tested venoms induced fast 
      spreading of pathological alterations in the blood vessels on the chorioallantoic 
      membrane. Our study discloses a detailed insight into microscopic level processes in 
      venom-induced changes observed on the chicken embryos and on the vascular network in 
      their chorioallantoic membrane. This article also highlights the increasing 
      importance of the role of the chicken embryos and the importance of observing 
      changes in the chorioallantoic membrane applied for toxicological and medical 
      research as an appropriate alternative animal model in relation to 3R's principles.

TI  - Philodryas (Serpentes: Dipsadidae) Envenomation, a Neglected Issue in Chile.
LID - 10.3390/toxins11120697 [doi]
LID - 697
AB  - Snakebite envenomation is considered a neglected tropical disease, although it also 
      occurs outside the tropics. In this work, we analyzed the literature on Philodryas 
      species in Chile (Philodryas chamissonis, P. simonsii, and P. tachymenoides) from 
      1834 to 2019, searching for epidemiological, clinical, and molecular aspects of 
      envenomation. Ninety-one percent of the studies found regarded taxonomy, ecology, 
      and natural history, suggesting that snakebites and venom toxins are a neglected 
      issue in Chile. All snakebite cases reported and toxicological studies concerned the 
      species Philodryas chamissonis. Using 185 distributional records from the literature 
      and museum collections for this species, we show for the first time that the 
      reported snakebite cases correlate with human population density, occurring in the 
      Valparaiso and Metropolitan regions in Central Chile. The reduced number of 
      snakebite cases, which were previously considered as having a low incidence in 
      Chile, may be a consequence of under-reported cases, probably due to the inadequate 
      publication or scarce research on this issue. Absence of information about official 
      pharmacological treatment, post-envenoming sequels, clinical management of 
      particular patient groups (e.g., with non-communicable diseases, pregnant women, and 
      the elderly) was also detected. In conclusion, despite having over 185 years of 
      literature on Chilean snakes, knowledge on the envenomation of Philodryas genus 
      remains scarce, seriously affecting adequate medical handling during an ophidic 
      accident. This review highlights the need to develop deep research in this area and 
      urgent improvements to the management of this disease in Chile.

TI  - Targeting Metastasis with Snake Toxins: Molecular Mechanisms.
LID - 10.3390/toxins9120390 [doi]
LID - 390
AB  - Metastasis involves the migration of cancer cells from a primary tumor to invade and 
      establish secondary tumors in distant organs, and it is the main cause for 
      cancer-related deaths. Currently, the conventional cytostatic drugs target the 
      proliferation of malignant cells, being ineffective in metastatic disease. This 
      highlights the need to find new anti-metastatic drugs. Toxins isolated from snake 
      venoms are a natural source of potentially useful molecular scaffolds to obtain 
      agents with anti-migratory and anti-invasive effects in cancer cells. While there is 
      greater evidence concerning the mechanisms of cell death induction of several snake 
      toxin classes on cancer cells; only a reduced number of toxin classes have been 
      reported on (i.e., disintegrins/disintegrin-like proteins, C-type lectin-like 
      proteins, C-type lectins, serinproteases, cardiotoxins, snake venom cystatins) as 
      inhibitors of adhesion, migration, and invasion of cancer cells. Here, we discuss 
      the anti-metastatic mechanisms of snake toxins, distinguishing three targets, which 
      involve (1) inhibition of extracellular matrix components-dependent adhesion and 
      migration, (2) inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and (3) inhibition 
      of migration by alterations in the actin/cytoskeleton network.

      Towards understanding its biological impact.

AB  - The European horntail woodwasp, Sirex noctilio, is an invasive insect that attacks 
      conifer hosts, particularly Pinus species. Venom injected by female S. noctilio, 
      together with its symbiotic fungus, damages the normal physiology of Pinus, leading 
      to death of the tree. To identify the proteinaceous components in the venom and 
      uncover the interplay between venom proteins and tree proteins, clarification of the 
      overall profile of proteins produced in the venom gland apparatus was carried out in 
      this work. The venom sac proteome utilised in-solution digested in either a natural 
      or deglycosylated state, prior to nanoHPLC LTQ-Orbitrap under CID/ETD mode. Here, we 
      report the identification of 1454 and 1225 proteins in venom and sac, respectively, 
      with 410 mutual proteins. Approximately 90 proteins were predicted to be secretory, 
      of which 8 have features characteristic of toxins. Chemosensory binding proteins 
      were also identified. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analysis were employed to 
      predict the protein functions and biological pathways in venom and sac. 
      Protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis suggested that one-step responses 
      represent the majority of the Sirex-Pinus PPIs, and the proteins representing 
      network hub nodes could be of importance for the development of pest management 
      strategies. SIGNIFICANCE: The woodwasp Sirex noctilio is an invasive species in many 
      parts of the world, including Australia and North America, where it is considered 
      within the top 10 most serious forest insects. Where they have been introduced, the 
      female woodwasps attack living pine trees, causing significant economic losses. 
      Central to this destruction is the woodwasp's life cycle requirement to bore a hole 
      to deposit eggs and a toxic mucus that disables the tree's network for transporting 
      water and nutrients, yet aids in larval survival. Here we specifically examine the 
      mucus gland apparatus and its contents, revealing the protein components that 
      together with 'noctilisin' facilitate this complex association. The identification 
      of chemosensory binding proteins further supports a role for the woodwasp ovipositor 
      as an instrument for early stages of host tree selection. These findings could 
      provide important clues towards the development of novel control tools against this 
      pest.

AB  - Spiders are diverse, predatory arthropods that have inhabited Earth for around 400 
      million years. They are well known for their complex venom systems that are used to 
      overpower their prey. Spider venoms contain many proteins and peptides with highly 
      specific and potent activities suitable for biomedical or agrochemical applications, 
      but the key role of venoms as an evolutionary innovation is often overlooked, even 
      though this has enabled spiders to emerge as one of the most successful animal 
      lineages. In this review, we discuss these neglected biological aspects of spider 
      venoms. We focus on the morphology of spider venom systems, their major components, 
      biochemical and chemical plasticity, as well as ecological and evolutionary trends. 
      We argue that the effectiveness of spider venoms is due to their unprecedented 
      complexity, with diverse components working synergistically to increase the overall 
      potency. The analysis of spider venoms is difficult to standardize because they are 
      dynamic systems, fine-tuned and modified by factors such as sex, life-history stage 
      and biological role. Finally, we summarize the mechanisms that drive spider venom 
      evolution and highlight the need for genome-based studies to reconstruct the 
      evolutionary history and physiological networks of spider venom compounds with more 
      certainty.

TI  - Association of a Network of Immunologic Response and Clinical Features With the 
      Functional Recovery From Crotalinae Snakebite Envenoming.
PG  - 628113

LID - 628113
AB  - BACKGROUND: The immunologic pathways activated during snakebite envenoming (SBE) are 
      poorly described, and their association with recovery is unclear. The immunologic 
      response in SBE could inform a prognostic model to predict recovery. The purpose of 
      this study was to develop pre- and post-antivenom prognostic models comprised of 
      clinical features and immunologic cytokine data that are associated with recovery 
      from SBE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study in an 
      academic medical center emergency department. We enrolled consecutive patients with 
      Crotalinae SBE and obtained serum samples based on previously described criteria for 
      the Surgical Critical Care Initiative (SC2i)(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: 
      NCT02182180). We assessed a standard set of clinical variables and measured 35 
      unique cytokines using Luminex Cytokine 35-Plex Human Panel pre- and post-antivenom 
      administration. The Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS), a well-validated 
      patient-reported outcome of functional recovery, was assessed at 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 
      days and the area under the patient curve (PSFS AUPC) determined. We performed 
      Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) modeling to represent relationships with a diagram 
      composed of nodes and arcs. Each node represents a cytokine or clinical feature and 
      each arc represents a joint-probability distribution (JPD). RESULTS: Twenty-eight 
      SBE patients were enrolled. Preliminary results from 24 patients with clinical data, 
      9 patients with pre-antivenom and 11 patients with post-antivenom cytokine data are 
      presented. The group was mostly female (82%) with a mean age of 38.1 (SD ± 9.8) 
      years. In the pre-antivenom model, the variables most closely associated with the 
      PSFS AUPC are predominantly clinical features. In the post-antivenom model, 
      cytokines are more fully incorporated into the model. The variables most closely 
      associated with the PSFS AUPC are age, antihistamines, white blood cell count (WBC), 
      HGF, CCL5 and VEGF. The most influential variables are age, antihistamines and EGF. 
      Both the pre- and post-antivenom models perform well with AUCs of 0.87 and 0.90 
      respectively. DISCUSSION: Pre- and post-antivenom networks of cytokines and clinical 
      features were associated with functional recovery measured by the PSFS AUPC over 28 
      days. With additional data, we can identify prognostic models using immunologic and 
      clinical variables to predict recovery from SBE.

AB  - Venoms are a rich source for the discovery of molecules with biotechnological 
      applications, but their analysis is challenging even for state-of-the-art 
      proteomics. Here we report on a large-scale proteomic assessment of the venom of 
      Loxosceles intermedia, the so-called brown spider. Venom was extracted from 200 
      spiders and fractioned into two aliquots relative to a 10 kDa cutoff mass. Each of 
      these was further fractioned and digested with trypsin (4 h), trypsin (18 h), pepsin 
      (18 h), and chymotrypsin (18 h), then analyzed by MudPIT on an LTQ-Orbitrap XL ETD 
      mass spectrometer fragmenting precursors by CID, HCD, and ETD. Aliquots of 
      undigested samples were also analyzed. Our experimental design allowed us to apply 
      spectral networks, thus enabling us to obtain meta-contig assemblies, and 
      consequently de novo sequencing of practically complete proteins, culminating in a 
      deep proteome assessment of the venom. Data are available via ProteomeXchange, with 
      identifier PXD005523.

      history.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Currently, there is strong evidence about an association between 
      hymenoptera venom anaphylaxis (HVA) and mastocytosis. This review is focused on the 
      most relevant clinical and biological features of systemic mastocytosis associated 
      with HVA. RECENT FINDINGS: HVA is a relatively common complication that modifies the 
      natural course of patients with mastocytosis, particularly men with indolent 
      systemic mastocytosis without skin lesions (ISMs-) in whom HVA can be the presenting 
      symptom in up to around one-half of the cases. Patients with ISMs- associated with 
      HVA are typically males with cardiovascular symptoms in the absence of itching, 
      urticaria, and angioedema during anaphylaxis. Noteworthy, ISMs- is characterized by 
      a low bone marrow mast cell load and a low risk for disease progression. Early and 
      more recent studies support that specific venom immunotherapy (VIT) is a 
      well-tolerated and effective treatment in patients with mastocytosis. SUMMARY: VIT 
      should be given life-long to all patients with mastocytosis and proven 
      immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated HVA. In patients with negative venom skin test and 
      undetectable IgE antibodies, additional studies such as component-based allergy 
      testing might contribute to confirm an IgE-mediated mechanism of anaphylaxis in some 
      cases, thus providing the indication of VIT.

TI  - Suppression of hypersynchronous network activity in cultured cortical neurons using 
      an ultrasoft silicone scaffold.
PG  - 3195-3202
LID - 10.1039/c9sm02432h [doi]
AB  - The spontaneous activity pattern of cortical neurons in dissociated culture is 
      characterized by burst firing that is highly synchronized among a wide population of 
      cells. The degree of synchrony, however, is excessively higher than that in cortical 
      tissues. Here, we employed polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomers to establish a 
      novel system for culturing neurons on a scaffold with an elastic modulus resembling 
      brain tissue, and investigated the effect of the scaffold's elasticity on network 
      activity patterns in cultured rat cortical neurons. Using whole-cell patch clamp to 
      assess the scaffold effect on the development of synaptic connections, we found that 
      the amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic current, as well as the frequency of 
      spontaneous transmissions, was reduced in neuronal networks grown on an ultrasoft 
      PDMS with an elastic modulus of 0.5 kPa. Furthermore, the ultrasoft scaffold was 
      found to suppress neural correlations in the spontaneous activity of the cultured 
      neuronal network. The dose of GsMTx-4, an antagonist of stretch-activated cation 
      channels (SACs), required to reduce the generation of the events below 1.0 event per 
      min on PDMS substrates was lower than that for neurons on a glass substrate. This 
      suggests that the difference in the baseline level of SAC activation is a molecular 
      mechanism underlying the alteration in neuronal network activity depending on 
      scaffold stiffness. Our results demonstrate the potential application of PDMS with 
      biomimetic elasticity as cell-culture scaffold for bridging the in vivo-in vitro gap 
      in neuronal systems.

TI  - Conus consors snail venom proteomics proposes functions, pathways, and novel 
      families involved in its venomic system.
PG  - 5046-58
LID - 10.1021/pr3006155 [doi]
AB  - For some decades, cone snail venoms have been providing peptides, generally termed 
      conopeptides, that exhibit a large diversity of pharmacological properties. However, 
      little attention has been devoted to the high molecular mass (HMM) proteins in 
      venoms of mollusks. In order to shed more light on cone snail venom HMM components, 
      the proteins of dissected and injected venom of a fish-hunting cone snail, Conus 
      consors, were extensively assessed. HMM venom proteins were separated by 
      two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by mass spectrometry 
      (MS). The MS data were interpreted using UniProt database, EST libraries from C. 
      consors venom duct and salivary gland, and their genomic information. Numerous 
      protein families were discovered in the lumen of the venom duct and assigned a 
      biological function, thus pointing to their potential role in venom production and 
      maturation. Interestingly, the study also revealed original proteins defining new 
      families of unknown function. Only two groups of HMM proteins passing the venom 
      selection process, echotoxins and hyaluronidases, were clearly present in the 
      injected venom. They are suggested to contribute to the envenomation process. This 
      newly devised integrated HMM proteomic analysis is a big step toward identification 
      of the protein arsenal used in a cone snail venom apparatus for venom production, 
      maturation, and function.

TI  - Effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists on waist circumference among type 2 diabetes 
      patients: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
PG  - 794-803
LID - 10.1007/s12020-014-0373-0 [doi]
AB  - Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are increasingly used in 
      patients with type 2 diabetes. However, the effect on abdominal obesity has not yet 
      been confirmed. The study aimed to systematically evaluate the effect of GLP-1RAs on 
      waist circumference in patients with type 2 diabetes. MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane 
      library and www.clinicaltrialgov were searched through October 31, 2013. Randomized 
      controlled trials with available data were selected if they compared GLP-1 RAs with 
      placebo and traditional anti-diabetic drugs with a duration≥8 weeks. Weighted mean 
      difference was estimated using random-effect model. Network meta-analysis was 
      performed to supplement direct comparisons. Seventeen trials with 12 treatments were 
      included. Overall, significant reductions on waist circumference following treatment 
      of liraglutide--1.8 mg once daily (-5.24 cm, 95% CI -7.68, -2.93), liraglutide--1.2 
      mg once daily (-4.73 cm, 95% CI -6.68, -2.65) and exenatide--10 μg twice daily 
      (-1.34 cm, 95 % CI -2.00, -0.75) were detected versus placebo. The reduction effect 
      was more evident when compared with insulin and thiazolidinediones (range -1.71 to 
      -8.03 cm). Compared with exenatide, liraglutide--0.6 mg once daily, taspoglutide, 
      liraglutide--1.2 mg once daily and liraglutide--1.8 mg once daily significantly 
      decreased waist circumference from -3.32 to -6.01 cm. Besides, liraglutide--1.8 mg 
      once daily significantly decreased waist circumference by -1.73 cm (95 % CI -3.04, 
      -0.55) versus sitagliptin, whereas no significant difference following 
      liraglutide--1.2-mg-once-daily treatment was detected compared with liraglutide--1.8 
      mg once daily and sitagliptin. Reduction was observed with statistical significance 
      for exenatide--10 μg twice daily compared with exenatide--5 μg twice daily (-1.21 
      cm, 95% CI -2.43, -0.06). Ranking probability analysis indicated liraglutide--1.8 mg 
      once daily and liraglutide--1.2 mg once daily decreased waist circumference most 
      among all 12 treatments with probability of 98.36% and 91.82%, respectively. Some 
      GLP-1RAs, especially liraglutide--1.8 mg once daily and liraglutide--1.2 mg once 
      daily, were associated with a significant reduction in waist circumference.

AB  - PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to assess the effect of glucagon-like peptide-1 
      receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) on lipid profiles in patients with type 2 diabetes. 
      METHODS: The MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases 
      were searched from inception through October 31, 2013. Randomized controlled trials 
      with available data were selected if they compared GLP-1 RAs with placebo and 
      traditional antidiabetic drugs with a duration ≥8 weeks. The weighted mean 
      difference for changes in lipid profiles was estimated by using the random effects 
      model, and a network meta-analysis was performed to supplement direct comparisons. 
      FINDINGS: Thirty-five trials with 13 treatments were included in the analysis. GLP-1 
      RAs decreased HDL-C with a range of -0.06 mmol/L (95% CI, -0.11 to -0.01) to -0.13 
      mmol/L (95% CI, -0.17 to -0.10) compared with thiazolidinediones, whereas 
      thiazolidinediones were associated with a significant increase in HDL-C compared 
      with placebo (0.09 mmol/L [95% CI, 0.06 to 0.12]). A significant reduction in LDL-C 
      was detected for all GLP-1 RAs versus placebo (range, -0.08 to -0.16 mmol/L), 
      insulin (range, -0.10 to -0.19 mmol/L), and thiazolidinediones (range, -0.16 to 
      -0.24 mmol/L). Exenatide, liraglutide 1.8 mg once daily, and taspoglutide decreased 
      total cholesterol with a range of -0.16 mmol/L (95% CI, -0.26 to -0.06) to -0.27 
      mmol/L (95% CI, -0.41 to -0.12) versus placebo and thiazolidinediones (range, -0.26 
      to -0.37 mmol/L). The decreased effect was more evident in exenatide long-acting 
      release and liraglutide 1.8 mg once daily. A significant reduction in triglyceride 
      levels was observed with liraglutide 1.8 mg once daily (-0.30 mmol/L [95% CI, -0.49 
      to -0.11]) and taspoglutide 20 mg once weekly (-0.17 mmol/L [95% CI, -0.31 to 
      -0.01]) versus placebo. IMPLICATIONS: GLP-1 RAs were associated with modest 
      reductions in LDL-C, total cholesterol, and triglycerides but no significant 
      improvement in HDL-C. Further evidence is needed to determine if improvements in 
      lipid profiles might translate into reductions in cardiovascular outcomes.

AB  - AIMS: To evaluate current evidence of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists 
      (GLP-1RAs) on blood pressure, heart rate, and hypertension in patients with type 2 
      diabetes. METHODS: Medline, Embase, the Cochrane library, and the website 
      www.clinicaltrials.gov were searched on April 5th, 2014. Randomized-controlled 
      trials with available data were included if they compared GLP-1RAs with placebo and 
      traditional antidiabetic drugs in patients with type 2 diabetes with duration ≥ 12 
      weeks. Weighted mean difference for blood pressure and heart rate, odds ratio (OR) 
      for hypertension were calculated by random-effect model. Network meta-analysis was 
      performed to supplement direct comparisons. RESULTS: Sixty trials with 14 treatments 
      were included. Compared with placebo, insulin, and sulfonylureas, GLP-1RAs decreased 
      systolic blood pressure with range from -1.84 mmHg (95% CI: -3.48 to -0.20) to -4.60 
      mmHg (95% CI: -7.18 to -2.03). Compared with placebo, a reduction in diastolic blood 
      pressure was detected significantly only for exenatide-10 μg-twice-daily (-1.08 
      mmHg, 95% CI: -1.78 to -0.33). Exenatide (2 mg once weekly), liraglutide 1.2 mg once 
      daily), and liraglutide (1.8 mg once daily) increased heart rate by 3.35 (95% CI: 
      1.23-5.50), 2.06 (95% CI: 0.43, 3.74), and 2.35 (95% CI: 0.94-3.76) beats/min versus 
      placebo. This effect was evident compared with active control (range: 2.22-3.62). No 
      significant association between incident hypertension and GLP-1RAs was detected, 
      except for the association between exenatide-10 μg-twice-daily and sulfonylureas 
      (OR, 0.40, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.82). CONCLUSIONS: GLP-1RAs were associated with modest 
      reduction on blood pressure, a slight increase in heart rate, yet no significant 
      association with hypertension. Further investigation to explore mechanisms is 
      warranted.

AB  - To evaluate the effectiveness of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 
      RAs) on weight reduction in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (Type 2 DM), a 
      network meta-analysis was conducted. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and 
      ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from 1950 to October 2013. Randomized controlled 
      trials (RCTs) involving GLP-1 RAs were included if they provided information on body 
      weight. A total of 51 RCTs were included and 17521 participants were enrolled. The 
      mean duration of 51 RCTs was 31 weeks. Exenatide 10 μg twice daily (EX10BID) reduced 
      weight compared with exenatide 5 μg twice daily (EX5BID), liraglutide 0.6 mg once 
      daily (LIR0.6QD), liraglutide-1.2 mg once daily (LIR1.2QD), and placebo treatment, 
      with mean differences of -1.07 kg (95% CI: -2.41, -0.02), -2.38 kg (95% CI: -3.71, 
      -1.06), -1.62 kg (95% CI: -2.79, -0.43), and -1.92 kg (95% CI: -2.61, -1.24), 
      respectively. Reductions of weight treated with liraglutide-1.8 mg once daily 
      (LIR1.8QD) reach statistical significance (-1.43 kg (95% CI: -2.73, -0.15)) versus 
      LIR1.2QD and (-0.98 kg (95% CI: -1.94, -0.02)) versus placebo. Network meta-analysis 
      found that EX10BID, LIR1.8QD, and EX2QW obtained a higher proportion of patients 
      with weight loss than other traditional hypoglycemic agents. Our results suggest 
      GLP-1 RAs are promising candidates for weight control in comparison with traditional 
      hypoglycemic drugs, and EX10BID, LIR1.8QD, and EX2QW rank the top three drugs.

      on the mechanisms of allergen immunotherapy based on the recent publications and 
      clinical trials. DATA SOURCES: PubMed literature review. STUDY SELECTIONS: In this 
      review, we focus on diverse mechanisms of AIT and provide an insight into 
      alternative routes of administration. Additionally, we review and discuss the most 
      recent studies investigating potential biomarkers and highlight their role in 
      clinical settings. RESULTS: Successful allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) induces 
      the reinstatement of tolerance toward allergens and represents a disease-modifying 
      treatment. In the last decades, substantial progress in understanding the mechanisms 
      of AIT has been achieved. Establishment of long-term clinical tolerance to allergens 
      engages a complex network of interactions, modulating the functions of basophils, 
      mast cells, allergen-specific regulatory T and B cells, and production of specific 
      antibodies. The reduction of symptoms and clinical improvement is achieved by 
      skewing the immune response away from allergic inflammation. CONCLUSION: Although 
      the complex nature of AIT mechanisms is becoming more clear, the need to discover 
      reliable biomarkers to define patients likely to respond to the treatment is 
      emerging.

TI  - The Multifocal Approach to Sharing in Shared Decision Making: A Critical Appraisal 
      of the MAPPIN'SDM.
PG  - 114-124
LID - 10.1177/0272989X211010738 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Shared decision making integrates health care provider expertise with 
      patient values and preferences. The MAPPIN'SDM is a recently developed measurement 
      instrument that incorporates physician, patient, and observer perspectives during 
      medical consultations. This review sought to critically appraise the development, 
      sensibility, reliability, and validity of the MAPPIN'SDM and to determine in which 
      settings it has been used. METHODS: This critical appraisal was performed through a 
      targeted review of the literature. Articles outlining the development or measurement 
      property assessment of the MAPPIN'SDM or that used the instrument for predictor or 
      outcome purposes were identified. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included. The 
      MAPPIN'SDM was developed by both adapting and building on previous shared decision 
      making measurement instruments, as well as through creation of novel items. Content 
      validity, face validity, and item quality of the MAPPIN'SDM are adequate. Internal 
      consistency ranged from 0.91 to 0.94 and agreement statistics from 0.41 to 0.92. The 
      MAPPIN'SDM has been evaluated in several populations and settings, ranging from 
      chronic disease to acute oncological settings. Limitations include high reading 
      levels required for self-administered patient questionnaires and the small number of 
      studies that have employed the instrument to date. CONCLUSION: The MAPPIN'SDM 
      generally shows adequate development, sensibility, reliability, and validity in 
      preliminary testing and holds promise for shared decision making research 
      integrating multiple perspectives. Further research is needed to develop its use in 
      other patient populations and to assess patient understanding of complex item 
      wording.

TI  - β-blockers and ACE inhibitors are not a risk factor for severe systemic sting 
      reactions and adverse events during venom immunotherapy.
PG  - 2166-2176
LID - 10.1111/all.14785 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is controversy whether taking β-blockers or ACE inhibitors (ACEI) 
      is a risk factor for more severe systemic insect sting reactions (SSR) and whether 
      it increases the number or severity of adverse events (AE) during venom 
      immunotherapy (VIT). METHODS: In this open, prospective, observational, multicenter 
      trial, we recruited patients with a history of a SSR and indication for VIT. The 
      primary objective of this study was to evaluate whether patients taking β-blockers 
      or ACEI show more systemic AE during VIT compared to patients without such 
      treatment. RESULTS: In total, 1,425 patients were enrolled and VIT was performed in 
      1,342 patients. Of all patients included, 388 (27.2%) took antihypertensive (AHT) 
      drugs (10.4% took β-blockers, 11.9% ACEI, 5.0% β-blockers and ACEI). Only 5.6% of 
      patients under AHT treatment experienced systemic AE during VIT as compared with 
      7.4% of patients without these drugs (OR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.43-1.22, p = 0.25). The 
      severity of the initial sting reaction was not affected by the intake of β-blockers 
      or ACEI (OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 0.89-1.46, p = 0.29). In total, 210 (17.7%) patients were 
      re-stung during VIT and 191 (91.0%) tolerated the sting without systemic symptoms. 
      Of the 19 patients with VIT treatment failure, 4 took β-blockers, none an ACEI. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This trial provides robust evidence that taking β-blockers or ACEI does 
      neither increase the frequency of systemic AE during VIT nor aggravate SSR. 
      Moreover, results suggest that these drugs do not impair effectiveness of VIT.

AB  - To elucidate the toxic mechanism of snake venom at the protein level, proteomics 
      technology was applied to investigate the effect of venom on circulation in the 
      mammalian body. Temporal proteomic analysis was performed to profile the dynamic 
      changes in the sera of Sprague-Dawley rats administered with Chinese cobra venom or 
      saline. Using 8-plex iTRAQ analysis, 392 and 636 serum proteins were identified to 
      be linearly upregulated or downregulated over time in the low-dose group and 
      high-dose group, respectively. These proteins were mainly associated with the acute 
      phase response pathway, complement system, and liver X receptor (LXR)/retinoid X 
      receptor (RXR) and farnesoid X receptor (FXR)/RXR activation pathways. Compared with 
      the low-dose group, the immune response and integrin pathways were inhibited in the 
      high-dose group, although no obvious effect was observed. With consistently higher 
      or lower expression in the high-dose group compared to the low-dose group throughout 
      the whole process of venom poisoning, two proteins, Kininogen-1 (KNG1) and 
      orosomucoid 1 (ORM1), which are involved in metabolism and immune response, occupied 
      a core position in the pathway network and are considered venom dose-dependent 
      biomarker candidates.

TI  - Venom Peptides with Dual Modulatory Activity on the Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel 
      Na(V)1.1 Provide Novel Leads for Development of Antiepileptic Drugs.
PG  - 119-134
LID - 10.1021/acsptsci.9b00079 [doi]
AB  - Voltage-gated sodium (Na(V)) channels play a fundamental role in normal neurological 
      function, especially via the initiation and propagation of action potentials. The 
      Na(V)1.1 subtype is found in inhibitory interneurons of the brain and it is 
      essential for maintaining a balance between excitation and inhibition in neuronal 
      networks. Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations of SCN1A, the gene encoding 
      Na(V)1.1, underlie Dravet syndrome (DS), a severe pediatric epilepsy. We recently 
      demonstrated that selective inhibition of Na(V)1.1 inactivation prevents seizures 
      and premature death in a mouse model of DS. Thus, selective modulators of Na(V)1.1 
      might be useful therapeutics for treatment of DS as they target the underlying 
      molecular deficit. Numerous scorpion-venom peptides have been shown to modulate the 
      activity of Na(V) channels, but little is known about their activity at Na(V)1.1. 
      Here we report the isolation, sequence, three-dimensional structure, recombinant 
      production, and functional characterization of two peptidic modulators of Na(V)1.1 
      from venom of the buthid scorpion Hottentotta jayakari. These peptides, Hj1a and 
      Hj2a, are potent agonists of Na(V)1.1 (EC(50) of 17 and 32 nM, respectively), and 
      they present dual α/β activity by modifying both the activation and inactivation 
      properties of the channel. NMR studies of rHj1a indicate that it adopts a 
      cystine-stabilized αβ fold similar to known scorpion toxins. Although Hj1a and Hj2a 
      have only limited selectivity for Na(V)1.1, their unusual dual mode of action 
      provides an alternative approach to the development of selective Na(V)1.1 modulators 
      for the treatment of DS.

TI  - Mapping Proteoforms and Protein Complexes From King Cobra Venom Using Both 
      Denaturing and Native Top-down Proteomics.
PG  - 2423-34
LID - 10.1074/mcp.M115.056523 [doi]
AB  - Characterizing whole proteins by top-down proteomics avoids a step of inference 
      encountered in the dominant bottom-up methodology when peptides are assembled 
      computationally into proteins for identification. The direct interrogation of whole 
      proteins and protein complexes from the venom of Ophiophagus hannah (king cobra) 
      provides a sharply clarified view of toxin sequence variation, transit peptide 
      cleavage sites and post-translational modifications (PTMs) likely critical for venom 
      lethality. A tube-gel format for electrophoresis (called GELFrEE) and solution 
      isoelectric focusing were used for protein fractionation prior to LC-MS/MS analysis 
      resulting in 131 protein identifications (18 more than bottom-up) and a total of 184 
      proteoforms characterized from 14 protein toxin families. Operating both GELFrEE and 
      mass spectrometry to preserve non-covalent interactions generated detailed 
      information about two of the largest venom glycoprotein complexes: the homodimeric 
      l-amino acid oxidase (∼130 kDa) and the multichain toxin cobra venom factor (∼147 
      kDa). The l-amino acid oxidase complex exhibited two clusters of multiproteoform 
      complexes corresponding to the presence of 5 or 6 N-glycans moieties, each 
      consistent with a distribution of N-acetyl hexosamines. Employing top-down 
      proteomics in both native and denaturing modes provides unprecedented 
      characterization of venom proteoforms and their complexes. A precise molecular 
      inventory of venom proteins will propel the study of snake toxin variation and the 
      targeted development of new antivenoms or other biotherapeutics.

TI  - Interpreting the Pharmacological Mechanisms of Huachansu Capsules on Hepatocellular 
      Carcinoma Through Combining Network Pharmacology and Experimental Evaluation.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most fatal cancers across the world. 
      Chinese medicine has been used as adjunctive or complementary therapy for the 
      management of HCC. Huachansu belongs to a class of toxic steroids isolated from toad 
      venom that has important anti-cancer property. This study was aimed to identify the 
      bioactive constituents and molecular targets of Huachansu capsules (HCSCs) for 
      treating HCC using network pharmacology analysis and experimental assays. The major 
      bioactive components of HCSCs were determined using ultra-performance liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). A series of network 
      pharmacology methods including target prediction, pathway identification, and 
      network establishment were applied to identify the modes of action of HCSCs against 
      HCC. Furthermore, a series of experiments, including MTT, clonogenic assay, 3-D 
      transwell, wound healing assay, as well as flow cytometry, were conducted to verify 
      the inhibitory ability of HCSCs on HCC in vitro. The results showed that 11 chemical 
      components were identified from HCSCs. The network pharmacological analysis showed 
      that there were 82 related anti-HCC targets and 14 potential pathways for these 11 
      components. Moreover, experimental assays confirmed the inhibitory effects of HCSCs 
      against HCC in vitro. Taken together, our study revealed the synergistic effects of 
      HCSCs on a systematic level, and suggested that HCSCs exhibited anti-HCC effects in 
      a multi-component, multi-target, and multi-pathway manner.

TI  - Behavioral, Physiological, Demographic and Ecological Impacts of Hematophagous and 
      Endoparasitic Insects on an Arctic Ungulate.
LID - 10.3390/toxins12050334 [doi]
LID - 334
AB  - Animals that deliver a toxic secretion through a wound or to the body surface 
      without a wound are considered venomous and toxungenous, respectively. Hematophagous 
      insects, such as mosquitoes (Aedes spp.), meet the criteria for venomous, and some 
      endoparasitic insects, such as warble flies (Hypoderma tarandi), satisfy the 
      definition for toxungenous. The impacts of these insects on their hosts are wide 
      ranging. In the Arctic, their primary host is the most abundant ungulate, the 
      caribou (Rangifer tarandus). The most conspicuous impacts of these insects on 
      caribou are behavioral. Caribou increase their movements during peak insect 
      harassment, evading and running away from these parasites. These behavioral 
      responses scale up to physiological effects as caribou move to less productive 
      habitats to reduce harassment which increases energetic costs due to locomotion, 
      reduces nutrient intake due to less time spent foraging, and can lead to poorer 
      physiological condition. Reduced physiological condition can lead to lower 
      reproductive output and even higher mortality rates, with the potential to 
      ultimately affect caribou demographics. Caribou affect all trophic levels in the 
      Arctic and the processes that connect them, thus altering caribou demographics could 
      impact the ecology of the region. Broadening the definitions of venomous and 
      toxungenous animals to include hematophagous and endoparasitic insects should not 
      only generate productive collaborations among toxinologists and parasitologists, but 
      will also lead to a deeper understanding of the ecology of toxic secretions and 
      their widespread influence.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Wasp venoms constitute a molecular reservoir of new pharmacological 
      substances such as peptides and proteins, biological property holders, many of which 
      are yet to be identified. Exploring these sources may lead to the discovery of 
      molecules hitherto unknown. This study describes, for the first time in hymenopteran 
      venoms, the identification of an enzymatically inactive phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) 
      from the venom of the social wasp Polybia occidentalis. METHODS: P. occidentalis 
      venom was fractioned by molecular exclusion and reverse phase chromatography. For 
      the biochemical characterization of the protein, 1D and 2D SDS-PAGE were performed, 
      along with phospholipase activity assays on synthetic substrates, MALDI-TOF mass 
      spectrometry and sequencing by Edman degradation. RESULTS: The protein, called 
      PocTX, was isolated using two chromatographic steps. Based on the phospholipase 
      activity assay, electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, the protein presented a high 
      degree of purity, with a mass of 13,896.47 Da and a basic pI. After sequencing by 
      the Edman degradation method, it was found that the protein showed a high identity 
      with snake venom PLA(2) homologues. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of an 
      enzymatically inactive PLA(2) isolated from wasp venom, similar to snake PLA(2) 
      homologues.

TI  - Peripheral Pain Modulation of Chrysaora pacifica Jellyfish Venom Requires Both 
      Ca(2+) Influx and TRPA1 Channel Activation in Rats.
PG  - 900-913
LID - 10.1007/s12640-020-00282-1 [doi]
AB  - The venom of jellyfish triggers severe dermal pain along with inflammation and 
      tissue necrosis, and occasionally, induces internal organ dysfunction. However, the 
      basic mechanisms underlying its cytotoxic effects are still unknown. Here, we report 
      one of the mechanisms involved in peripheral pain modulation associated with 
      inflammatory and neurotoxic oxidative signaling in rats using the venom of 
      jellyfish, Chrysaora pacifica (CpV). This jellyfish is identified by brown tentacles 
      carrying nematocysts filled with cytotoxic venom that induces severe pain, pruritus, 
      tentacle marks, and blisters. The subcutaneous injection of CpV into rat forepaws in 
      behavioral tests triggered nociceptive response with a decreased threshold for 
      mechanical pain perception. These responses lasted up to 48 h and were completely 
      blocked by verapamil and TTA-P2, T-type Ca(2+) channel blockers, or HC030031, a 
      transient receptor potential cation ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channel blocker, while another 
      Ca(2+) channel blocker, nimodipine, was ineffective. Also, treatment with Ca(2+) 
      chelators (EGTA and BaptaAM) significantly alleviated the CpV-induced pain response. 
      These results indicate that CpV-induced pain modulation may require both Ca(2+) 
      influx through the T-type Ca(2+) channels and activation of TRPA1 channels. 
      Furthermore, CpV induced Ca(2+)-mediated oxidative neurotoxicity in the dorsal root 
      ganglion (DRG) and cortical neurons dissociated from rats, resulting in decreased 
      neuronal viability and increased intracellular levels of ROS. Taken together, CpV 
      may activate Ca(2+)-mediated oxidative signaling to produce excessive ROS acting as 
      an endogenous agonist of TRPA1 channels in the peripheral terminals of the primary 
      afferent neurons, resulting in persistent inflammatory pain. These findings provide 
      strong evidence supporting the therapeutic effectiveness of blocking oxidative 
      signaling against pain and cytotoxicity induced by jellyfish venom.

TI  - Venom of a parasitoid wasp induces prolonged grooming in the cockroach.
PG  - 957-64
AB  - The parasitoid wasp Ampulex compressa hunts cockroaches Periplaneta americana, 
      stinging them first in the thorax and then in the head, the sting penetrating 
      towards the subesophageal ganglion. After being stung the cockroach grooms almost 
      continuously for approximately 30 min, performing all the normal components of 
      grooming behavior. This excessive grooming is only seen after the head sting and 
      cannot be attributed to stress, to contamination of the body surface or to systemic 
      or peripheral effects. This suggests that the venom is activating a neural network 
      for grooming. We suggest that the venom induces prolonged grooming by stimulating 
      dopamine receptors in the cockroach, for the following reasons. (1) Reserpine, which 
      causes massive release of monoamines, induces excessive grooming. (2) Dopamine 
      injected into the hemocoel also induces excessive grooming and is significantly more 
      effective than octopamine or serotonin. In addition, the dopamine agonist SKF 82958 
      induces excessive grooming when injected directly into the subesophageal ganglion. 
      (3) Injection of the dopamine antagonist flupenthixol greatly reduces venom-induced 
      grooming. (4) Dopamine, or a dopamine-like substance, is present in the venom.

LID - 10.1016/j.toxicon.2011.07.016 [doi]
AB  - Electrophysiological and pharmacological studies coupled with molecular 
      identification have revealed a unique network of ion channels--Kv1.3, KCa3.1, CRAC 
      (Orai1 + Stim1), TRPM7, Cl(swell)--in lymphocytes that initiates and maintains the 
      calcium signaling cascade required for activation. The expression pattern of these 
      channels changes during lymphocyte activation and differentiation, allowing the 
      functional network to adapt during an immune response. The Kv1.3 channel is of 
      interest because it plays a critical role in subsets of T and B lymphocytes 
      implicated in autoimmune disorders. The ShK toxin from the sea anemone Stichodactyla 
      helianthus is a potent blocker of Kv1.3. ShK-186, a synthetic analog of ShK, is 
      being developed as a therapeutic for autoimmune diseases, and is scheduled to begin 
      first-in-man phase-1 trials in 2011. This review describes the journey that has led 
      to the development of ShK-186.

TI  - Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor Targeting in Cancer Treatment: Emerging Signaling 
      Networks and Therapeutic Applications.
PG  - 508-14
AB  - Growth factors of the bombesin/gastrin releasing peptide (BN/GRP) family play a 
      critical role in proliferation and progression of malignancies. Inhibitors targeting 
      GRP signalling have been developed and tested as anticancer compounds showing 
      promising preclinical and early phase clinical results. In this review, we will 
      discuss the molecular signaling, expression and the functional role of BN/GRP-GRPR 
      in different cancer models and will focus on the available strategies to target 
      BN/GRP-GRPR in cancer treatment as well as in tumour diagnosis and follow up.

AB  - Providers caring for patients with mastocytosis are tasked with the decision to 
      consider therapeutic options. This can come with some trepidation because 
      information available in the public domain lists numerous mast cell (MC) activators 
      based on data that do not discriminate between primates, rodents, and MC lines; do 
      not consider dosage; and do not take into account previous exposure and resultant 
      clinical findings. This being said, there is support in the literature for an 
      enhanced MC response in some patients with mastocytosis and in cases in which there 
      is a greater incidence of adverse reactions associated with certain antigens, such 
      as venoms and drugs. Thus this report provides a comprehensive guide for those 
      providers who must decide on therapeutic options in the management of patients with 
      clonal MC disease.

TI  - Identification of Conomarphin Variants in the Conus eburneus Venom and the Effect of 
      Sequence and PTM Variations on Conomarphin Conformations.
LID - 10.3390/md18100503 [doi]
LID - 503
AB  - Marine cone snails belonging to the Conidae family make use of neuroactive peptides 
      in their venom to capture prey. Here we report the proteome profile of the venom 
      duct of Conus eburneus, a cone snail belonging to the Tesseliconus clade. Through 
      tandem mass spectrometry and database searching against the C. eburneus 
      transcriptome and the ConoServer database, we identified 24 unique conopeptide 
      sequences in the venom duct. The majority of these peptides belong to the T and M 
      gene superfamilies and are disulfide-bonded, with cysteine frameworks V, XIV, 
      VI/VII, and III being the most abundant. All seven of the Cys-free peptides are 
      conomarphin variants belonging to the M superfamily that eluted out as dominant 
      peaks in the chromatogram. These conomarphins vary not only in amino acid residues 
      in select positions along the backbone but also have one or more post-translational 
      modifications (PTMs) such as proline hydroxylation, C-term amidation, and 
      γ-carboxylation of glutamic acid. Using molecular dynamics simulations, the 
      conomarphin variants were predicted to predominantly have hairpin-like or elongated 
      structures in acidic pH. These two structures were found to have significant 
      differences in electrostatic properties and the inclusion of PTMs seems to 
      complement this disparity. The presence of polar PTMs (hydroxyproline and 
      γ-carboxyglutamic acid) also appear to stabilize hydrogen bond networks in these 
      conformations. Furthermore, these predicted structures are pH sensitive, becoming 
      more spherical and compact at higher pH. The subtle conformational variations 
      observed here might play an important role in the selection and binding of the 
      peptides to their molecular targets.

TI  - Venomics and antivenomics of the poorly studied Brazil's lancehead, Bothrops brazili 
      (Hoge, 1954), from the Brazilian State of Pará.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Brazil's lancehead, Bothrops brazili, is a poorly studied pit viper 
      distributed in lowlands of the equatorial rainforests of southern Colombia, 
      northeastern Peru, eastern Ecuador, southern and southeastern Venezuela, Guyana, 
      Suriname, French Guiana, Brazil, and northern Bolivia. Few studies have been 
      reported on toxins isolated from venom of Ecuadorian and Brazilian B. brazili. The 
      aim of the present study was to elucidate the qualitative and quantitative protein 
      composition of B. brazili venom from Pará (Brazil), and to carry out a comparative 
      antivenomics assessment of the immunoreactivity of the Brazilian antibothropic 
      pentavalent antivenom [soro antibotrópico (SAB) in Portuguese] against the venoms of 
      B. brazili and reference species, B. jararaca. METHODS: We have applied a 
      quantitative snake venomics approach, including reverse-phase and two-dimensional 
      electrophoretic decomplexation of the venom toxin arsenal, LC-ESI-MS mass profiling 
      and peptide-centric MS/MS proteomic analysis, to unveil the overall protein 
      composition of B. brazili venom from Pará (Brazil). Using third-generation 
      antivenomics, the specific and paraspecific immunoreactivity of the Brazilian SAB 
      against homologous (B. jararaca) and heterologous (B. brazili) venoms was 
      investigated. RESULTS: The venom proteome of the Brazil's lancehead (Pará) is 
      predominantly composed of two major and three minor acidic (19%) and two major and 
      five minor basic (14%) phospholipase A(2) molecules; 7-11 snake venom 
      metalloproteinases of classes PI (21%) and PIII (6%); 10-12 serine proteinases 
      (14%), and 1-2 L-amino acid oxidases (6%). Other toxins, including two cysteine-rich 
      secretory proteins, one C-type lectin-like molecule, one nerve growth factor, one 
      5'-nucleotidase, one phosphodiesterase, one phospholipase B, and one glutaminyl 
      cyclase molecule, represent together less than 2.7% of the venom proteome. Third 
      generation antivenomics profile of the Brazilian pentabothropic antivenom showed 
      paraspecific immunoreactivity against all the toxin classes of B. brazili venom, 
      with maximal binding capacity of 132.2 mg venom/g antivenom. This figure indicates 
      that 19% of antivenom's F(ab')(2) antibodies bind B. brazili venom toxins. 
      CONCLUSION: The proteomics outcome contribute to a deeper insight into the spectrum 
      of toxins present in the venom of the Brazil's lancehead, and rationalize the 
      pathophysiology underlying this snake bite envenomings. The comparative qualitative 
      and quantitative immunorecognition profile of the Brazilian pentabothropic antivenom 
      toward the venom toxins of B. brazili and B. jararaca (the reference venom for 
      assessing the bothropic antivenom's potency in Brazil), provides clues about the 
      proper use of the Brazilian antibothropic polyvalent antivenom in the treatment of 
      bites by the Brazil's lancehead.

TI  - MmTX1 and MmTX2 from coral snake venom potently modulate GABAA receptor activity.
PG  - E891-900
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1415488112 [doi]
AB  - GABAA receptors shape synaptic transmission by modulating Cl(-) conductance across 
      the cell membrane. Remarkably, animal toxins that specifically target GABAA 
      receptors have not been identified. Here, we report the discovery of micrurotoxin1 
      (MmTX1) and MmTX2, two toxins present in Costa Rican coral snake venom that tightly 
      bind to GABAA receptors at subnanomolar concentrations. Studies with recombinant and 
      synthetic toxin variants on hippocampal neurons and cells expressing common receptor 
      compositions suggest that MmTX1 and MmTX2 allosterically increase GABAA receptor 
      susceptibility to agonist, thereby potentiating receptor opening as well as 
      desensitization, possibly by interacting with the α(+)/β(-) interface. Moreover, 
      hippocampal neuron excitability measurements reveal toxin-induced transitory network 
      inhibition, followed by an increase in spontaneous activity. In concert, toxin 
      injections into mouse brain result in reduced basal activity between intense 
      seizures. Altogether, we characterized two animal toxins that enhance GABAA receptor 
      sensitivity to agonist, thereby establishing a previously unidentified class of 
      tools to study this receptor family.

AB  - One of the principal functions of the trans Golgi network (TGN) is the sorting of 
      proteins into distinct vesicular transport carriers that mediate secretion and 
      interorganelle trafficking. Are lipids also sorted into distinct TGN-derived 
      carriers? The Golgi is the principal site of the synthesis of sphingomyelin (SM), an 
      abundant sphingolipid that is transported. To address the specificity of SM 
      transport to the plasma membrane, we engineered a natural SM-binding pore-forming 
      toxin, equinatoxin II (Eqt), into a nontoxic reporter termed Eqt-SM and used it to 
      monitor intracellular trafficking of SM. Using quantitative live cell imaging, we 
      found that Eqt-SM is enriched in a subset of TGN-derived secretory vesicles that are 
      also enriched in a glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored protein. In contrast, an 
      integral membrane secretory protein (CD8α) is not enriched in these carriers. Our 
      results demonstrate the sorting of native SM at the TGN and its transport to the 
      plasma membrane by specific carriers.

AB  - Analysis of natural host-parasite relationships reveals the evolutionary forces that 
      shape the delicate and unique specificity characteristic of such interactions. The 
      accessory long gland-reservoir complex of the wasp Leptopilina heterotoma 
      (Figitidae) produces venom with virus-like particles. Upon delivery, venom 
      components delay host larval development and completely block host immune responses. 
      The host range of this Drosophila endoparasitoid notably includes the highly-studied 
      model organism, Drosophila melanogaster. Categorization of 827 unigenes, using 
      similarity as an indicator of putative homology, reveals that approximately 25% are 
      novel or classified as hypothetical proteins. Most of the remaining unigenes are 
      related to processes involved in signaling, cell cycle, and cell physiology 
      including detoxification, protein biogenesis, and hormone production. Analysis of L. 
      heterotoma's predicted venom gland proteins demonstrates conservation among endo- 
      and ectoparasitoids within the Apocrita (e.g., this wasp and the jewel wasp Nasonia 
      vitripennis) and stinging aculeates (e.g., the honey bee and ants). Enzyme and KEGG 
      pathway profiling predicts that kinases, esterases, and hydrolases may contribute to 
      venom activity in this unique wasp. To our knowledge, this investigation is among 
      the first functional genomic studies for a natural parasitic wasp of Drosophila. Our 
      findings will help explain how L. heterotoma shuts down its hosts' immunity and shed 
      light on the molecular basis of a natural arms race between these insects.

TI  - Modulation of expression of fear by oxytocin signaling in the central amygdala: From 
      reduction of fear to regulation of defensive behavior style.

AB  - Many studies in preclinical animal models have described fear-reducing effects of 
      the neuropeptide oxytocin in the central nucleus of the amygdala. However, recent 
      studies have refined the role of oxytocin in the central amygdala, which may extend 
      to the selection of an active defensive coping style in the face of immediate 
      threat, and also fear-enhancing effects have been reported. On top of this, oxytocin 
      enables the discrimination of unfamiliar conspecifics on the basis of their 
      emotional state, which could allow for the selection of an appropriate coping style. 
      This is in line with many observations that support the hypothesis that the precise 
      outcome of oxytocin signaling in the central amygdala or other brain regions depends 
      on the emotional or physiological state of an animal. In this review, we highlight a 
      number of studies to exemplify the diverse effects oxytocin exerts on fear in the 
      central amygdala of rodents. These are discussed in the context of the organization 
      of the neural network within the central amygdala and in relation to the 
      oxytocin-synthesizing neurons in the hypothalamus.

AB  - Snake venom toxins are related not only in detention, death and the promotion of 
      initial digestion of prey but also due to their different biochemical, structural 
      and pharmacological effects they can result in new drugs. Among these toxins snake 
      venom serine proteases (SVSPs) should be highlighted because they are responsible 
      for inducing changes in physiological functions such as blood coagulation, 
      fibrinolysis, and platelet aggregation. This article presents the first serine 
      protease (SP) isolated from Bothrops brazili: BbrzSP-32. The new SP showed 36 kDa of 
      relative molecular mass and its absolute mass was confirmed by mass spectrometry as 
      32,520 Da. It presents 79.48% identity when compared to other SVSPs and was able to 
      degrade the α-chain of fibrinogen, in in vitro models, because of this it is 
      considered a SVTLE-A. It showed dose-dependent activity in the process of 
      degradation of fibrin networks demonstrating greater specificity for this activity 
      when compared to its thrombolytic action. BbrzSP-32 demonstrated proteolytic 
      activity on gelatin and chromogenic substrates for serine proteases and 
      thrombin-like enzymes (S-2288 and S-2238 respectively), besides having coagulant 
      activity on human plasma. After pre-incubation with PMSF and benzamidine the 
      coagulant and proteolytic activities on the S-2288 and S-2238 substrates were 
      reduced. BbrzSP-32 shows stability against pH and temperature variations, 
      demonstrating optimum activity between 30 and 40 °C and in the pH range 7.5 to 8.5. 
      A new SP with potential biotechnological application was isolated.

TI  - Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and fracture risk: a network meta-analysis 
      of randomized clinical trials.
PG  - 2639-2644

AB  - Our network meta-analysis analyzed the effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor 
      agonists (GLP-1 RAs) on fracture risk. By combining data from randomized controlled 
      trials, we found that GLP-1 RAs were associated with a decreased bone fracture risk, 
      and exenatide is the best option agent with regard to the risk of fracture. This 
      study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018094433). INTRODUCTION: Data on the 
      effects of GLP-1 RAs on fracture risk are conflicted. This study aimed to analyze 
      the available evidence on the effects of GLP-1 RAs on fracture risk in type 2 
      diabetes mellitus patients. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for relevant 
      published articles, and unpublished studies presented at ClinicalTrials.gov were 
      searched for relevant clinical data. All analyses were performed with STATA 12.0 and 
      R software (Version 3.4.4). We estimated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence 
      interval (CI) by combining RRs for fracture effects of included trials. RESULTS: 
      There were 54 eligible random control trials (RCTs) with 49,602 participants, 
      including 28,353 patients treated with GLP-1 RAs. Relative to placebo, exenatide 
      (RR, 0.17; 95% CI 0.03-0.67) was associated with lowest risk of fracture among other 
      GLP-1 RAs. Exenatide had the highest probability to be the safest option with regard 
      to the risk of fracture (0.07 ‰), followed by dulaglutide (1.04%), liraglutide 
      (1.39%), albiglutide (5.61%), lixisenatide (8.07%), and semaglutide (18.72%). A 
      statistically significant inconsistency was observed in some comparisons. 
      CONCLUSION: The Bayesian network meta-analysis suggests that GLP-1 RAs were 
      associated with a decreased bone fracture risk compared to users of placebo or other 
      anti-hyperglycemic drugs in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, and exenatide is the 
      best option agent with regard to the risk of fracture.

AB  - Parasitic worm proteins that belong to the cysteine-rich secretory proteins, antigen 
      5 and pathogenesis-related 1 (CAP) superfamily are proposed to play key roles in the 
      infection process and the modulation of immune responses in host animals. However, 
      there is limited information on these proteins for most socio-economically important 
      worms. Here, we review the CAP protein superfamily of Haemonchus contortus (barber's 
      pole worm), a highly significant parasitic roundworm (order Strongylida) of small 
      ruminants. To do this, we mined genome and transcriptomic datasets, predicted and 
      curated full-length amino acid sequences (n=45), undertook systematic phylogenetic 
      analyses of these data and investigated transcription throughout the life cycle of 
      H. contortus. We inferred functions for selected Caenorhabditis elegans orthologs 
      (including vap-1, vap-2, scl-5 and lon-1) based on genetic networking and by 
      integrating data and published information, and were able to infer that a subset of 
      orthologs and their interaction partners play pivotal roles in growth and 
      development via the insulin-like and/or the TGF-beta signalling pathways. The 
      identification of the important and conserved growth regulator LON-1 led us to 
      appraise the three-dimensional structure of this CAP protein by comparative 
      modelling. This model revealed the presence of different topological moieties on the 
      canonical fold of the CAP domain, which coincide with an overall charge separation 
      as indicated by the electrostatic surface potential map. These observations suggest 
      the existence of separate sites for effector binding and receptor interactions, and 
      thus support the proposal that these worm molecules act in similar ways as venoms 
      act as ligands for chemokine receptors or G protein-coupled receptor effectors. In 
      conclusion, this review should guide future molecular studies of these molecules, 
      and could support the development of novel interventions against haemonchosis.

TI  - Contributions of NMDA receptors to network recruitment and rhythm generation in 
      spinal cord cultures.
PG  - 521-32
AB  - N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors are implicated in fictive locomotion; 
      however, their precise role there is not clear. In cultures of dissociated cells 
      from foetal rat spinal cord, synchronous bursting (but not fictive locomotion) can 
      be induced by disinhibition, which is produced by blocking glycinergic and 
      gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A-dependent synaptic conductances. In this study, we 
      investigate the role of NMDA-R in rhythm generation during disinhibition with 
      multielectrode arrays and patch-clamp. We previously determined that bursting 
      activity is generated by repetitive recruitment of a network through recurrent 
      excitation. Blocking NMDA-R with d(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (APV) 
      decreased the burst duration, suggesting a role of such receptors in the maintenance 
      of high network activity during the bursts. In addition, APV reduced burst rate in 
      about a third of the experiments, suggesting a contribution of NMDA-R in network 
      recruitment. When (+/-)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid 
      hydrate (AMPA)/kainate receptors were blocked with 
      6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) in the presence of disinhibition, the 
      burst rate was reduced and burst onset was slowed in two-thirds of the experiments. 
      In the remaining experiments, bursting ceased completely with CNQX. Neither APV nor 
      CNQX changed the spatial patterns of activity in the network, suggesting a 
      co-operation of both receptors in rhythm generation. While NMDA alone was not able 
      to create a rhythm, it accelerated bursting in the presence of disinhibition, made 
      it more regular and slowed down network recruitment. These effects were most likely 
      due to the depolarization of the interneurons in the network. We conclude that 
      NMDA-R contribute to rhythm generation in spinal cultures by supporting recurrent 
      excitation and network recruitment and by depolarizing the network.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are an established 
      treatment for people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We aimed to indirectly compare two 
      GLP-1 receptor agonists, once weekly dulaglutide 1.5 mg and once daily liraglutide 
      1.8 mg, as a part of clinical trial planning. METHODS: Studies for inclusion in the 
      network meta-analysis (NMA) included all available dulaglutide and liraglutide data 
      as of November 2011 as well as results from the exenatide once weekly registration 
      programme. Change from baseline in haemoglobin A1c (A1c) was the primary endpoint, 
      and a 26-week treatment effect was estimated. RESULTS: Data for 7135 people with T2D 
      from 15 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) followed for 12-52 weeks were included 
      in the quantitative analysis. Observed results from the NMA predicted an A1c change 
      from baseline of -15.1 mmol/mol (-1.38%) in the dulaglutide 1.5 mg group and -14.7 
      mmol/mol (-1.34%) in the liraglutide 1.8 mg group, with a predicted treatment 
      difference (dulaglutide-liraglutide) of -0.4 mmol/mol (-0.04%) [95% credible 
      interval: -2.4 to 1.5 mmol/mol (-0.22% to 0.14%)]. CONCLUSIONS: The subsequent RCT 
      primary result of a -0.7 mmol/mol (-0.06%) treatment difference 
      (dulaglutide-liraglutide) in A1c demonstrated that once weekly dulaglutide 1.5 mg 
      and once daily liraglutide 1.8 mg resulted in similar glycaemic control, which was 
      consistent with the NMA-predicted treatment difference. NMA is a useful tool and 
      should be considered during clinical trial planning.

TI  - Identification of the main venom protein components of Aphidius ervi, a parasitoid 
      wasp of the aphid model Acyrthosiphon pisum.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Endoparasitoid wasps are important natural enemies of the widely 
      distributed aphid pests and are mainly used as biological control agents. However, 
      despite the increased interest on aphid interaction networks, only sparse 
      information is available on the factors used by parasitoids to modulate the aphid 
      physiology. Our aim was here to identify the major protein components of the venom 
      injected at oviposition by Aphidius ervi to ensure successful development in its 
      aphid host, Acyrthosiphon pisum. RESULTS: A combined large-scale transcriptomic and 
      proteomic approach allowed us to identify 16 putative venom proteins among which 
      three γ-glutamyl transpeptidases (γ-GTs) were by far the most abundant. Two of the 
      γ-GTs most likely correspond to alleles of the same gene, with one of these alleles 
      previously described as involved in host castration. The third γ-GT was only 
      distantly related to the others and may not be functional owing to the presence of 
      mutations in the active site. Among the other abundant proteins in the venom, 
      several were unique to A. ervi such as the molecular chaperone endoplasmin possibly 
      involved in protecting proteins during their secretion and transport in the host. 
      Abundant transcripts encoding three secreted cystein-rich toxin-like peptides whose 
      function remains to be explored were also identified. CONCLUSIONS: Our data further 
      support the role of γ-GTs as key players in A. ervi success on aphid hosts. However, 
      they also evidence that this wasp venom is a complex fluid that contains diverse, 
      more or less specific, protein components. Their characterization will undoubtedly 
      help deciphering parasitoid-aphid and parasitoid-aphid-symbiont interactions. 
      Finally, this study also shed light on the quick evolution of venom components 
      through processes such as duplication and convergent recruitment of virulence 
      factors between unrelated organisms.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of a myotoxin from the venom of Macrovipera lebetina 
      transmediterranea.
PG  - 381-90
LID - 10.1016/j.toxicon.2010.04.001 [doi]
AB  - The Macrovipera lebetina venom consists of a complex mixture of proteins belonging 
      to a few main families according to their enzymatic and pharmacological activity. 
      Given the serious pathophysiological effects caused by M. lebetina bites mainly 
      induced by muscle degeneration, we decided to investigate the myotoxic activity of 
      some venom fractions. In the present study we describe the purification and 
      characterization of a 22.600 kDa protein, named in the following Mlp4.2, that shares 
      myotoxic but not haemorrhagic activity in vivo. Herein we report that Mlp4.2 is a 
      metalloproteinase belonging to the PI-SVMPS family able, in vitro, to proteolyse 
      extracellular matrix proteins as laminin and fibronectin. Histological observations 
      of mouse anterior tibialis Mlp4.2-treated muscle, demonstrate that this protein 
      induces a massive degeneration of myofibers but not haemorrhage. The 
      immunofluorescence analysis of protein-treated anterior tibialis, demonstrates that 
      Mlp4.2 is able to disarray the laminin network surrounding muscle fibers. Finally 
      Mlp4.2 did not show any direct cytolytic activity towards the myogenic cell line 
      C2C12 in culture. The data reported herein suggest that the myotoxicity of Mlp4.2 is 
      primarily linked to the disruption of the muscle fibers interaction with 
      extracellular matrix proteins.

TI  - Comparison of the Venom Peptides and Their Expression in Closely Related Conus 
      Species: Insights into Adaptive Post-speciation Evolution of Conus Exogenomes.
PG  - 1797-814
LID - 10.1093/gbe/evv109 [doi]
AB  - Genes that encode products with exogenous targets, which comprise an organism's 
      "exogenome," typically exhibit high rates of evolution. The genes encoding the venom 
      peptides (conotoxins or conopeptides) in Conus sensu lato exemplify this class of 
      genes. Their rapid diversification has been established and is believed to be linked 
      to the high speciation rate in this genus. However, the molecular mechanisms that 
      underlie venom peptide diversification and ultimately emergence of new species 
      remain poorly understood. In this study, the sequences and expression levels of 
      conotoxins from several specimens of two closely related worm-hunting species, Conus 
      tribblei and Conus lenavati, were compared through transcriptome analysis. Majority 
      of the identified putative conopeptides were novel, and their diversity, even in 
      each specimen, was remarkably high suggesting a wide range of prey targets for these 
      species. Comparison of the interspecific expression patterns of conopeptides at the 
      superfamily level resulted in the discovery of both conserved as well as 
      species-specific expression patterns, indicating divergence in the regulatory 
      network affecting conotoxin gene expression. Comparison of the transcriptomes of the 
      individual snails revealed that each specimen produces a distinct set of highly 
      expressed conopeptides, reflecting the capability of individual snails to fine-tune 
      the composition of their venoms. These observations reflect the role of sequence 
      divergence and divergence in the control of expression for specific conopeptides in 
      the evolution of the exogenome and hence venom composition in Conus.

AB  - About 1% of scorpion stings in Iran have been reported in cities and more than 5% in 
      rural areas. The genus Hemiscorpous lepturus belongs to the family Hemiscorpiidae 
      that is endemic in the south-western province of Khoozestan and other parts of 
      western Iran. Although this species is responsible for only 10% of the reported 
      stings, it is also responsible for 95% of mortalities. The heavy cytotoxic and 
      neurotoxic venomous effects of scorpion sting may cause serious disorders such as 
      erythema, purpuric changes, bulla, necrosis and ulcer, either alone or in 
      combination. The toxic effects of H. lepturus venom cause vast changes in both 
      primary and secondary metabolites of the victim, which finally lead to death if not 
      treated early enough. Metabolomics is the systematic study of chemical fingerprints 
      resulting from cytotoxic and pathogenic reactions of cells. We studied the toxic 
      mechanism of H. lepturus venom on metabolome profiling of the victims along with 
      biochemical pathways, organs and physiological detectable effects of this venom by 
      the help of (1)H NMR. Our results showed that pyrimidine, histidine and tyrosine 
      metabolisms, and steroid hormone biosynthesis were the most affected pathways. The 
      major action of the crude venom is on the pancreas, and also on the nerve cells, 
      spleen and mitochondria, causing acute seizures, which resemble the early markers of 
      myocardial injury and seizure disorders.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: A major concern in modern society involves the 
      lasting detrimental behavioral effects of exposure to alcoholic beverages. 
      Consequently, hundreds of folk remedies for hangover have been suggested, most of 
      them without a scientific basis, for lack of proper test systems. Over centuries, 
      yellow toadflax (Linaria vulgaris Mill., Lv) tincture has been used in Russian 
      traditional medicine to treat the spectrum of hangover symptoms such as vertigo, 
      headache, drunken behaviors, and as a sedative. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here we use 
      in-vitro cultured hippocampal neurons to examine the effect of the Lv extract as 
      well as the flavonoid acetylpectolinarin (ACP) exclusively found in Lv extract, on 
      spontaneous network activity of the cultured neurons exposed to low, physiological 
      concentrations of ethanol. RESULTS: As in previous studies, low (0.25-0.5%) ethanol 
      causes an increase in network activity, which was converted to suppression, with 
      high concentrations of ethanol. Lv extract and ACP, at low concentrations, had no 
      appreciable effect on spontaneous activity, but they blocked the facilitating action 
      of low ethanol. This action of ACP was also seen when the culture was exposed to 
      1-EBIO, a SK potassium channel opener, and was blocked by apamin, an SK channel 
      antagonist. In contrast, ACP or Lv extracts did not reverse the suppressive effects 
      of higher ethanol. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that ACP acts by interacting 
      with the SK channel, to block the facilitatory effect of low concentration of 
      ethanol, on network activity in hippocampal cultures.

AB  - Synchronized network activity is an essential attribute of the brain. Yet the 
      cellular mechanisms that determine the duration of network bursts are not fully 
      understood. In the present study, synchronized network bursts were evoked by 
      triggering an action potential in a single neuron in otherwise silent microcultures 
      consisting of 4-30 hippocampal neurons. The evoked burst duration, ∼2 s, depended on 
      the recovery time after a previous burst. While interburst intervals of 35 s enabled 
      full-length bursts, they were shortened by half at 5-s intervals. This reduction in 
      burst duration could not be attributed to postsynaptic parameters such as glutamate 
      receptor desensitization, accumulating afterhyperpolarization, inhibitory tone, or 
      sodium channel inactivation. Reducing extracellular Ca(2+) concentration 
      ([Ca(2+)](o)) relieved the effect of short intervals on burst duration, while 
      depletion of synaptic vesicles with α-latrotoxin gradually eliminated network 
      bursts. Finally, a transient exposure to high [K(+)](o) slowed down the recovery 
      time following a burst discharge. We conclude that the limiting factor regulating 
      burst duration is most likely the depletion of presynaptic resources.

TI  - Use of a phosphopeptide as a ligand to purify phospholipase A(2) from the venom of 
      Crotalus durisuss terrificus by affinity chromatography.

AB  - The venom of Crotalus durissus terrificus (Cdt) is a source of a wide variety of 
      toxins, some of them with interesting pharmacological applications. Of these toxins, 
      the phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) subunit of crotoxin (Ctx) has been studied for its 
      potential as an antiviral and antibacterial agent. Peptides have proven useful 
      ligands for the purification of numerous molecules, including antibodies, toxins, 
      enzymes and other proteins. Here, we sought to use a phosphopeptide (P-Lys) as a 
      ligand for PLA(2) purification. P-Lys was synthesized in solid phase on 
      Rink-Amide-ChemMatrix resin, immobilized on NHS-agarose, and then evaluated as a 
      chromatographic matrix. Under the best conditions, total protein adsorption reached 
      39% and only the eluate fraction presented PLA(2) activity. Analysis of the eluate 
      by SDS-PAGE showed three bands, one corresponding to the molecular weight of PLA(2) 
      (14 kDa). Said bands were analyzed by mass spectrometry and identified as PLA(2) and 
      its multimers. The final product showed a purity of over 90%. In addition, slightly 
      changing the process conditions also allowed the isolation of crotamine.

TI  - Comparative Efficacy of Drugs for Preventing Acute Kidney Injury after Cardiac 
      Surgery: A Network Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 49-58
LID - 10.1007/s40256-017-0245-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs frequently after cardiac surgery and 
      has been associated with increased hospital length of stay, mortality, and costs. 
      OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of pharmacologic strategies for 
      preventing AKI after cardiac surgery. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, the 
      Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to 6 May 2017 and the 
      reference lists of relevant articles about trials. The outcome was the occurrence of 
      AKI. This is the first network meta-analysis of the different prevention strategies 
      using Bayesian methodology. RESULTS: The study included 63 articles with 19,520 
      participants and evaluated the effect of ten pharmacologic strategies to prevent AKI 
      in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Compared with placebo, the odds ratio (OR) 
      for the occurrence of AKI was 0.24 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16-0.34] with 
      natriuretic peptide, 0.33 (95% CI 0.14-0.70) with fenoldopam, 0.54 (95% CI 
      0.31-0.84) with dexmedetomidine, 0.56 (95% CI 0.29-0.95) with low-dose 
      erythropoietin, 0.63 (95% CI 0.43-0.88) with levosimendan, 0.76 (95% CI 0.52-1.10) 
      with steroids, 0.83 (95% CI 0.48-1.40) with high-dose erythropoietin, 0.85 (95% CI 
      0.64-1.14) with N-acetylcysteine, 0.96 (95% CI 0.69-1.29) with sodium bicarbonate, 
      and 1.05 (95% CI 0.70-1.41) with statins. The surface under the cumulative ranking 
      curve probabilities indicated that natriuretic peptide was the best treatment 
      therapy and that fenoldopam ranked second. CONCLUSIONS: Natriuretic peptide is 
      probably the preferred pharmacologic strategy to prevent AKI in adult patients 
      undergoing cardiac surgery, especially in those at high risk of AKI.

AB  - Different chemotherapy drugs are generally introduced in clinical practices 
      combining with therapy for glioma treatment. However, these chemotherapy drugs have 
      rarely been compared with each other and the optimum drug still remains to be 
      proved. In this research, medical databases were consulted, PubMed, Embase and 
      Cochrane Library included. As primary outcomes, hazard ratio (HR) of overall 
      survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) with their corresponding 95% 
      credential intervals (CrI) were reported. A network meta-analysis was conducted; the 
      surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was utilized for treatment rank 
      and a cluster analysis based on SUCRA values was performed. This research includes 
      14 trials with 3,681 subjects and eight interventions. In terms of network 
      meta-analysis, placebo was proved to be inferior to the combination of temozolomide 
      (TMZ), nimustine (ACNU) and cisplatin (CDDP). Also, bevacizumab (BEV) in conjunction 
      with TMZ were significantly more effective than placebo with an HR of 0.40. The 
      estimated probabilities from SUCRA verified the above outcomes, confirming that the 
      combination of TMZ, ACNU and CDDP exhibited the highest ranking probability of 0.889 
      with respect to OS, while BEV in combination with TMZ - with a probability of 0.772 
      - ranked the first place with respect to PFS. According to the results of this 
      network meta-analysis, the combination of (1) TMZ, ACNU and CDDP; (2) BEV in 
      combination with TMZ and (3) cilengitide in combination with TMZ, are considered as 
      the preferable choices of chemotherapy drugs for glioma treatment.

TI  - Pro and antiinflammatory properties of toxins from animal venoms.
PG  - 401-11
AB  - Accidents evoked by venomous animals are common in tropical regions. In Brazil, 
      envenomation evoked by snakes, spiders and scorpions are an important public health 
      problem. Their venoms are composed of a great number of toxins, which are capable of 
      acting on tissue and plasma components with consequent toxic and pharmacological 
      effects. On the other hand, the diversity of venom composition makes them important 
      source of toxins that can be employed as scientific tools. Here we describe the 
      mechanisms of anti and pro-inflammatory properties of toxins of Bothrops and 
      Crotalus genus snakes and Loxosceles and Phoneutria genus spider venoms. The 
      emphasis was to summarise, both in vivo and in vitro, studies that focused on the 
      action of phospholipases, metalloproteinases and sphingomyelinase D on vascular and 
      cellular aspects of the process as well as the complex network of chemical mediators 
      involved.

TI  - The Transcriptome of the Zoanthid Protopalythoa variabilis (Cnidaria, Anthozoa) 
      Predicts a Basal Repertoire of Toxin-like and Venom-Auxiliary Polypeptides.
PG  - 3045-3064
AB  - Protopalythoa is a zoanthid that, together with thousands of predominantly marine 
      species, such as hydra, jellyfish, and sea anemones, composes the oldest eumetazoan 
      phylum, i.e., the Cnidaria. Some of these species, such as sea wasps and sea 
      anemones, are highly venomous organisms that can produce deadly toxins for preying, 
      for defense or for territorial disputes. Despite the fact that hundreds of organic 
      and polypeptide toxins have been characterized from sea anemones and jellyfish, 
      practically nothing is known about the toxin repertoire in zoanthids. Here, based on 
      a transcriptome analysis of the zoanthid Protopalythoa variabilis, numerous 
      predicted polypeptides with canonical venom protein features are identified. These 
      polypeptides comprise putative proteins from different toxin families: neurotoxic 
      peptides, hemostatic and hemorrhagic toxins, membrane-active (pore-forming) 
      proteins, protease inhibitors, mixed-function venom enzymes, and venom auxiliary 
      proteins. The synthesis and functional analysis of two of these predicted toxin 
      products, one related to the ShK/Aurelin family and the other to a recently 
      discovered anthozoan toxin, displayed potent in vivo neurotoxicity that impaired 
      swimming in larval zebrafish. Altogether, the complex array of venom-related 
      transcripts that are identified in P. variabilis, some of which are first reported 
      in Cnidaria, provides novel insight into the toxin distribution among species and 
      might contribute to the understanding of composition and evolution of venom 
      polypeptides in toxiferous animals.

AB  - Snake venom serine proteinases are toxins that perturb hemostasis acting on proteins 
      from the blood coagulation cascade, the fibrinolytic or the kallikrein-kinin system. 
      Despite the relevance of these enzymes in envenomations by viper bites, the 
      characterization of the antibody response to these toxins at the molecular level has 
      not been previously addressed. In this work surface-located B cell recognized linear 
      epitopes from a Lachesis stenophrys venom serine proteinase (UniProt accession 
      number Q072L7) were predicted using an artificial neuronal network at the ABCpred 
      server, the corresponding peptides were synthesized and their immunoreactivity was 
      analyzed against a panel of experimental and therapeutic antivenoms. A molecular 
      model of the L. stenophrys enzyme was built using as a template the structure of the 
      D. acutus Dav-PA serine proteinase (Q9I8X1), which displays the highest degree of 
      sequence similarity to the L. stenophrys enzyme among proteins of known 3D 
      structure, and the surface-located epitopes were identified in the protein model 
      using iCn3D. A total of 13 peptides corresponding to the surface exposed predicted 
      epitopes from L. stenophrys serine proteinase were synthesized and, their reactivity 
      with a rabbit antiserum against the recombinant enzyme and a panel of antivenoms was 
      evaluated by a capture ELISA. Some of the epitopes recognized by monospecific and 
      polyspecific antivenoms comprise sequences overlapping motifs conserved in viper 
      venom serine proteinases. The identification and characterization of relevant 
      epitopes recognized by B cells in snake venom toxins may provide valuable 
      information for the preparation of immunogens that help in the production of 
      improved therapeutic antivenoms.

TI  - First European data from the network of severe allergic reactions (NORA).
PG  - 1397-404
LID - 10.1111/all.12475 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Occurrence, elicitors and treatment of severe allergic reactions are 
      recognized and reported differently between countries. We aimed to collect 
      standardized data throughout Europe on anaphylaxis referred for diagnosis and 
      counselling. METHODS: Tertiary allergy, dermatology and paediatric units in 10 
      European countries took part in this pilot phase of the first European Anaphylaxis 
      Registry, from June 2011 to March 2014. An online questionnaire was used to collect 
      data on severe allergic reactions based on the medical history and diagnostics. 
      RESULTS: Fifty-nine centres reported 3333 cases of anaphylaxis, with 26.7% below 
      18 years of age. Allergic reactions were mainly caused by food (children and adults 
      64.9% and 20.2%, respectively) and insect venom (20.2% and 48.2%) and less often by 
      drugs (4.8% and 22.4%). Most reactions occurred within 30 min of exposure (80.5%); a 
      delay of 4+ hours was mainly seen in drug anaphylaxis (6.7%). Symptom patterns 
      differed by elicitor, with the skin being affected most often (84.1%). A previous, 
      usually milder reaction to the same allergen was reported by 34.2%. The mainstay of 
      first-line treatment by professionals included corticoids (60.4%) and antihistamines 
      (52.8%). Only 13.7% of lay- or self-treated reactions to food and 27.6% of insect 
      anaphylaxis received on-site adrenaline. CONCLUSION: This pilot phase of a 
      pan-European registry for severe allergic reactions provides for the first time data 
      on anaphylaxis throughout Europe, demonstrates its potential functionality and 
      allows a comparison of symptom patterns, elicitors and treatment habits between 
      referral centres and countries.

      unbinding transitional states.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.46170 [doi]
LID - e46170
AB  - In silico and in vitro studies have made progress in understanding protein-protein 
      complex formation; however, the molecular mechanisms for their dissociation are 
      unclear. Protein-protein complexes, lasting from microseconds to years, often 
      involve induced-fit, challenging computational or kinetic analysis. Charybdotoxin 
      (CTX), a peptide from the Leiurus scorpion venom, blocks voltage-gated K(+)-channels 
      in a unique example of binding/unbinding simplicity. CTX plugs the external mouth of 
      K(+)-channels pore, stopping K(+)-ion conduction, without inducing conformational 
      changes. Conflicting with a tight binding, we show that external permeant ions 
      enhance CTX-dissociation, implying a path connecting the pore, in the toxin-bound 
      channel, with the external solution. This sensitivity is explained if CTX wobbles 
      between several bound conformations, producing transient events that restore the 
      electrical and ionic trans-pore gradients. Wobbling may originate from a network of 
      contacts in the interaction interface that are in dynamic stochastic equilibria. 
      These partially-bound intermediates could lead to distinct, and potentially 
      manipulable, dissociation pathways.

TI  - Pharmacological characterization of cnidarian extracts from the Caribbean Sea: 
      evaluation of anti-snake venom and antitumor properties.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cnidarians produce toxins, which are composed of different polypeptides 
      that induce pharmacological effects of biotechnological interest, such as antitumor, 
      antiophidic and anti-clotting activities. This study aimed to evaluate toxicological 
      activities and potential as antitumor and antiophidic agents contained in total 
      extracts from five cnidarians: Millepora alcicornis, Stichodactyla helianthus, 
      Plexaura homomalla, Bartholomea annulata and Condylactis gigantea (total and body 
      wall). METHODS: The cnidarian extracts were evaluated by electrophoresis and for 
      their phospholipase, proteolytic, hemorrhagic, coagulant, fibrinogenolytic, 
      neuromuscular blocking, muscle-damaging, edema-inducing and cytotoxic activities. 
      RESULTS: All cnidarian extracts showed indirect hemolytic activity, but only S. 
      helianthus induced direct hemolysis and neurotoxic effect. However, the hydrolysis 
      of NBD-PC, a PLA(2) substrate, was presented only by the C. gigantea (body wall) and 
      S. helianthus. The extracts from P. homomalla and S. helianthus induced edema, while 
      only C. gigantea and S. helianthus showed intensified myotoxic activity. The 
      proteolytic activity upon casein and fibrinogen was presented mainly by B. annulata 
      extract and all were unable to induce hemorrhage or fibrinogen coagulation. 
      Cnidarian extracts were able to neutralize clotting induced by Bothrops jararacussu 
      snake venom, except M. alcicornis. All cnidarian extracts were able to inhibit 
      hemorrhagic activity induced by Bothrops moojeni venom. Only the C. gigantea (body 
      wall) inhibited thrombin-induced coagulation. All cnidarian extracts showed 
      antitumor effect against Jurkat cells, of which C. gigantea (body wall) and S. 
      helianthus were the most active; however, only C. gigantea (body wall) and M. 
      alcicornis were active against B16F10 cells. CONCLUSION: The cnidarian extracts 
      analyzed showed relevant in vitro inhibitory potential over the activities induced 
      by Bothrops venoms; these results may contribute to elucidate the possible 
      mechanisms of interaction between cnidarian extracts and snake venoms.

TI  - The Effects of Exenatide Once Weekly (EXQW) and Exenatide Twice a Day (EXBID) on 
      Beta-Cell Function in Type 2 Diabetes: A Systematic Review and Network 
      Meta-Analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and poor glycemic 
      control receiving metformin (MET), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 
      RAs) are recommended as the adjunctive therapy. However, there are only a few 
      studies involving the comparative effects of exenatide twice a day (EXBID) and 
      exenatide once weekly (EXQW) on HOMA-β. This meta assessed the comparative effects 
      of EXQW and EXBID on HOMA-β among T2DM patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, 
      Cochrane Library, and Embase databases were searched to collect randomized 
      controlled trials (RCTs). Network meta-analysis was performed, and network diagrams 
      were constructed to evaluate the effects. The primary outcome is HOMA-β, and the 
      secondary outcomes are fasting blood glycose (FBG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and 
      weight loss. RESULTS: A total of 8 studies with 3506 subjects were included. 
      Compared with other antidiabetic agents, EXQW has a greater improvement in HOMA-β 
      than EXBID (weight mean difference (WMD) = -0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 
      [-0.64, -0.28], P = 0.001). The effect of EXQW on HbA1c is superior to that of 
      sitagliptin (SITA) (WMD = 0.51, 95% CI [0.03, 0.99], P = 0.037). The significant 
      reduction of weight was detected for EXBID in comparison with EXQW (WMD = -0.73, 95% 
      CI [-1.13, -0.33], P = 0.001), and no significant difference was found between EXQW 
      and MET. CONCLUSIONS: EXQW shows a greater improvement in HOMA-β than EXBID. 
      Moreover, the efficacy of EXQW on glycemic control is similar to other antidiabetic 
      agents including EXBID. It is an advisable treatment for diabetic patients to 
      improve HOMA-β and has an advantage of fewer number of injections compared with 
      EXBID, to increase patients' adherence and quality of life.

PG  - 119-125
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiology, treatment and adverse events after 
      snakebite in Australia. DESIGN: Prospective, multicentre study of data on patients 
      with snakebites recruited to the Australian Snakebite Project (2005-2015) and data 
      from the National Coronial Information System. Setting, participants: Patients 
      presenting to Australian hospitals with suspected or confirmed snakebites from July 
      2005 to June 2015 and consenting to participation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      Demographic data, circumstances of bites, clinical effects of envenoming, results of 
      laboratory investigations and snake venom detection kit (SVDK) testing, antivenom 
      treatment and adverse reactions, time to discharge, deaths. RESULTS: 1548 patients 
      with suspected snakebites were enrolled, including 835 envenomed patients (median, 
      87 per year), for 718 of which the snake type was definitively established, most 
      frequently brown snakes (41%), tiger snakes (17%) and red-bellied black snakes 
      (16%). Clinical effects included venom-induced consumption coagulopathy (73%), 
      myotoxicity (17%), and acute kidney injury (12%); severe complications included 
      cardiac arrest (25 cases; 2.9%) and major haemorrhage (13 cases; 1.6%). There were 
      23 deaths (median, two per year), attributed to brown (17), tiger (four) and unknown 
      (two) snakes; ten followed out-of-hospital cardiac arrests and six followed 
      intracranial haemorrhages. Of 597 SVDK test results for envenomed patients with 
      confirmed snake type, 29 (4.9%) were incorrect; 133 of 364 SVDK test results for 
      non-envenomed patients (36%) were false positives. 755 patients received antivenom, 
      including 49 non-envenomed patients; 178 (24%), including ten non-envenomed 
      patients, had systemic hypersensitivity reactions, of which 45 (6%) were severe 
      (hypotension, hypoxaemia). Median total antivenom dose declined from four vials to 
      one, but median time to first antivenom was unchanged (4.3 hours; IQR, 2.7-6.3 
      hours). CONCLUSIONS: Snake envenoming is uncommon in Australia, but is often severe. 
      SVDKs were unreliable for determining snake type. The median antivenom dose has 
      declined without harming patients. Improved early diagnostic strategies are needed 
      to reduce the frequently long delays before antivenom administration.

AB  - Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor stimulation ameliorates parkinsonian motor 
      and non-motor deficits in both experimental animals and patients; however, the 
      disease-modifying mechanisms of GLP-1 receptor activation have remained unknown. The 
      present study investigated whether exendin-4 (a GLP-1 analogue) can rescue motor 
      deficits and exert disease-modifying effects in a parkinsonian rat model of 
      α-synucleinopathy. This model was established by unilaterally injecting 
      AAV-9-A53T-α-synuclein into the right substantia nigra pars compacta, followed by 4 
      or 8 weeks of twice-daily intraperitoneal injections of exendin-4 (5 μg/kg/day) 
      starting at 2 weeks after AAV-9-A53T-α-synuclein injections. Positron emission 
      tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scanning and immunostaining established that 
      treatment with exendin-4 attenuated tyrosine-hydroxylase-positive neuronal loss and 
      terminal denervation and mitigated the decrease in expression of vesicular monoamine 
      transporter 2 within the nigrostriatal dopaminergic systems of rats injected with 
      AAV-9-A53T-α-synuclein. It also mitigated the parkinsonian motor deficits assessed 
      in behavioral tests. Furthermore, through both in vivo and in vitro models of 
      Parkinson's disease, we showed that exendin-4 promoted autophagy and mediated 
      degradation of pathological α-synuclein, the effects of which were counteracted by 
      3-methyladenine or chloroquine, the autophagic inhibitors. Additionally, exendin-4 
      attenuated dysregulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in rats injected with 
      AAV-9-A53T-α-synuclein. Taken together, our results demonstrate that exendin-4 
      treatment relieved behavioral deficits, dopaminergic degeneration, and pathological 
      α-synuclein aggregation in a parkinsonian rat model of α-synucleinopathy and that 
      these effects were mediated by enhanced autophagy via inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR 
      pathway. In light of the safety and tolerance of exendin-4 administration, our 
      results suggest that exendin-4 may represent a promising disease-modifying treatment 
      for Parkinson's disease.

AB  - AIM: This study was performed to delineate the kinin (receptor)-dependent pathways 
      in the Indian red scorpion (Mesobuthus tamulus; MBT) venom-induced pulmonary oedema 
      as well as the augmentation of cardio-pulmonary reflexes evoked by phenyldiguanide 
      (PDG). METHODS: In urethane-anaesthetized adult rats, the effect of venom on the PDG 
      reflex responses (blood pressure, heart rate and respiration rate) and the pulmonary 
      water content was ascertained using various antagonists(des- Arg, B(1) receptor 
      antagonist; Hoe 140, B(2) receptor antagonist; N(omega)-nitro-l-arginine methyl 
      ester (l-NAME), nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor; methylene blue, soluble 
      guanylate cyclase inhibitor; and glibenclamide, K(+)(ATP) channel blocker). The 
      effect of phosphodiesterase V inhibitor (sildenafil citrate) on the reflex response 
      and the pulmonary water content was also examined and compared with venom-induced 
      responses. RESULTS: Intravenous injection of PDG (10 microg kg(-1)) evoked apnoea, 
      bradycardia and hypotension lasting >60 s. Exposure to MBT venom (100 microg kg(-1)) 
      for 30 min augmented the PDG reflex responses by two times and increased the 
      pulmonary water content, significantly. Hoe 140 blocked the venom-induced responses 
      (augmentation of PDG reflex and increased pulmonary water content) whereas des-Arg 
      did not. l-NAME, methylene blue or glibenclamide also blocked the venom-induced 
      responses. Furthermore, sildenafil citrate (that increases cGMP levels) produced 
      augmentation of PDG reflex response and increased the pulmonary water content as 
      seen with venom. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that venom-induced responses 
      involve B(2) kinin receptors via the NO-dependent guanylate cyclase-cGMP pathway 
      involving K(+)(ATP) channels.

AB  - Bungarus multicinctus is one of the top ten venomous snakes in China, and its bite 
      causes acute and severe diseases, but its pathophysiology remains poorly elucidated. 
      Thus, an animal model of Bungarus multicinctus bite was established by intramuscular 
      injection of 30μg/kg of Bungarus multicinctus venom, and then the serum metabolites 
      were subsequently screened, identified and validated by ultra-performance liquid 
      chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight-mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) methods 
      to explore the potential biomakers and possible metabolic pathways. Untargeted 
      metabolomics analysis showed that 36 and 38 endogenous metabolites levels changed in 
      ESI+ and ESI-, respectively, KEGG pathway analysis showed that 5 metabolic pathways, 
      including mineral absorption, central carbon metabolism in cancer, protein digestion 
      and absorption, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and ABC transporters might be closely 
      related to Bungarus multicinctus bite. Targeted metabolomics analysis showed that 
      there were significant differences in serum D-proline, L-leucine and L-glutamine 
      after Bungarus multicinctus bite (P < 0.05). In addition, receiver operating 
      characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that the diagnostic efficiency of L-Glutamine 
      was superior to other potential biomarkers and the AUC value was 0.944. Moreover, we 
      found evidence for differences in the pathophysiology of glutamine between Bungarus 
      multicinctus bite group and normal group, specifically with the content of glutamine 
      synthetase (GS) and glutaminase (GLS). Taken together, the current study has 
      successfully established an animal model of Bungarus multicinctus bite, and further 
      identified the links between the metabolic perturbations and the pathophysiology and 
      the potential diagnostic biomakers of Bungarus multicinctus bite, which provided 
      valuable insights for studying the mechanism of Bungarus multicinctus bite.

PG  - 245-61
LID - 10.1017/S1740925X11000081 [doi]
AB  - In adult olfactory nerves of mammals and moths, a network of glial cells ensheathes 
      small bundles of olfactory receptor axons. In the developing antennal nerve (AN) of 
      the moth Manduca sexta, the axons of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) migrate from 
      the olfactory sensory epithelium toward the antennal lobe. Here we explore 
      developmental interactions between ORN axons and AN glial cells. During early stages 
      in AN glial-cell migration, glial cells are highly dye coupled, dividing glia are 
      readily found in the nerve and AN glial cells label strongly for glutamine 
      synthetase. By the end of this period, dye-coupling is rare, glial proliferation has 
      ceased, glutamine synthetase labeling is absent, and glial processes have begun to 
      extend to enwrap bundles of axons, a process that continues throughout the remainder 
      of metamorphic development. Whole-cell and perforated-patch recordings in vivo from 
      AN glia at different stages of network formation revealed two potassium currents and 
      an R-like calcium current. Chronic in vivo exposure to the R-type channel blocker 
      SNX-482 halted or greatly reduced AN glial migration. Chronically blocking 
      spontaneous Na-dependent activity by injection of tetrodotoxin reduced the glial 
      calcium current implicating an activity-dependent interaction between ORNs and glial 
      cells in the development of glial calcium currents.

TI  - Efficacy of different antidiabetic drugs based on metformin in the treatment of type 
      2 diabetes mellitus: A network meta-analysis involving eight eligible 
      randomized-controlled trials.
PG  - 2795-2806
LID - 10.1002/jcp.27097 [doi]
AB  - Diabetes mellitus is one of the most prevalent metabolic diseases globally and it is 
      increasing in prevalence. It is one of the most expensive diseases with respect to 
      total health care costs per patient as a result of its chronic nature and its severe 
      complications. To provide a more effective treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      (T2DM), this study aims to compare different efficacies of six kinds of hypoglycemic 
      drugs based on metformin, including glimepiride, pioglitazone, exenatide, 
      glibenclamide, rosiglitazone, and vildagliptin, in T2DM by a network meta-analysis 
      that were verified by randomized-controlled trials (RCTs). Eight eligible RCT in 
      consistency with the aforementioned six hypoglycemic drugs for T2DM were included. 
      The results of network meta-analysis demonstrated that the exenatide + metformin and 
      vildagliptin + metformin regimens presented with better efficacy. Patients with T2DM 
      with unsatisfactory blood glucose control based on diet control, proper exercise, 
      and metformin treatment were included. The original regimen and dose of medication 
      were unchanged, followed by the addition of glimepiride, pioglitazone, exenatide, 
      glibenclamide, rosiglitazone, and vildagliptin. The results of RCTs showed that all 
      these six kinds of drugs reduced the HbA1c level. Compared with other regimens, 
      exenatide + metformin reduced fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting plasma insulin 
      (FPI), total cholesterol (TC), and homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance 
      index (HOMA-IR) levels, but increased the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level; 
      vildagliptin + metformin decreased FPI and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels; 
      glibenclamide + metformin decreased the FPG level, but promoted HDL; and 
      glimepiride + metformin decreased the TC level and rosiglitazone + metformin reduced 
      the LDL level. Our findings indicated that exenatide + metformin and 
      vildagliptin + metformin have better efficacy in T2DM since they can improve insulin 
      sensitivity.

LID - 10.1124/mol.115.100784 [doi]
AB  - Many spider-venom peptides are known to modulate the activity of the voltage-gated 
      sodium (NaV) subtype 1.7 (NaV1.7) channel, which has emerged as a promising 
      analgesic target. In particular, a class of spider-venom peptides (NaSpTx1) has been 
      found to potently inhibit NaV1.7 (nanomolar IC50), and has been shown to produce 
      analgesic effects in animals. However, one member of this family [µ-TRTX-Hhn2b 
      (Hhn2b)] does not inhibit mammalian NaV channels expressed in dorsal root ganglia at 
      concentrations up to 100 µM. This peptide is classified as a NaSpTx1 member by 
      virtue of its cysteine spacing and sequence conservation over functionally important 
      residues. Here, we have performed detailed structural and functional analyses of 
      Hhn2b, leading us to identify two nonpharmacophore residues that contribute to human 
      NaV1.7 (hNaV1.7) inhibition by nonoverlapping mechanisms. These findings allowed us 
      to produce a double mutant of Hhn2b that shows nanomolar inhibition of hNaV1.7. 
      Traditional structure/function analysis did not provide sufficient resolution to 
      identify the mechanism underlying the observed gain of function. However, by solving 
      the high-resolution structure of both the wild-type and mutant peptides using 
      advanced multidimensional NMR experiments, we were able to uncover a previously 
      unknown network of interactions that stabilize the pharmacophore region of this 
      class of venom peptides. We further monitored the lipid binding properties of the 
      peptides and identified that one of the key amino acid substitutions also 
      selectively modulates the binding of the peptide to anionic lipids. These results 
      will further aid the development of peptide-based analgesics for the treatment of 
      chronic pain.

PG  - 750
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2019.00750 [doi]
LID - 750
AB  - Background: Elicitors and symptoms of anaphylaxis are age dependent. However, little 
      is known about typical features of anaphylaxis in patients aged 65 years or more. 
      Methods: The data from the Network for Online Registration of Anaphylaxis (NORA) 
      considering patients aged ≥65 (elderly) in comparison to data from adults (18-64 
      years) regarding elicitors, symptoms, comorbidities, and treatment measures were 
      analyzed. Results: We identified 1,123 elderly anaphylactic patients. Insect venoms 
      were the most frequent elicitor in this group (p < 0.001), followed by drugs like 
      analgesics and antibiotics. Food allergens elicited less frequently anaphylaxis (p < 
      0.001). Skin symptoms occurred less frequently in elderly patients (77%, p < 0.001). 
      The clinical symptoms were more severe in the elderly (51% experiencing grade III/IV 
      reactions), in particular when skin symptoms (p < 0.001) were absent. Most 
      strikingly, a loss of consciousness (33%, p < 0.001) and preexisting cardiovascular 
      comorbidity (59%, p < 0.001) were more prevalent in the elderly. Finally, adrenaline 
      was used in 30% of the elderly (vs. 26% in the comparator group, p < 0.001) and 
      hospitalization was more often required (60 vs. 50%, p < 0.001). Discussion and 
      Conclusion: Anaphylaxis in the elderly is often caused by insect venoms and drugs. 
      These patients suffer more often from cardiovascular symptoms, receive more 
      frequently adrenaline and require more often hospitalization. The data indicate that 
      anaphylaxis in the elderly tends to be more frequently life threatening and patients 
      require intensified medical intervention. The data support the need to recognize 
      anaphylaxis in this patient group, which is prone to be at a higher risk for a fatal 
      outcome.

AB  - Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) exerts a wide range of biological effects and attracts a lot 
      of attention of researchers. Two sites are involved in manifestation of PLA2 
      enzymatic activity: catalytic site responsible for substrate binding and fatty acid 
      cleavage from the sn-2 position of a glycerophospholipid, and interface binding site 
      (IBS) responsible for the protein binding to lipid membrane. IBS is formed by 
      positively charged and hydrophobic amino acids on the outer surface of the protein 
      molecule. Understanding the mechanism of PLA2 interaction with the lipid membrane is 
      the most challenging step in biochemistry of this enzyme. We used a combination of 
      experimental and computer simulation techniques to clarify molecular details of bee 
      venom PLA2 interaction with lipid bilayers formed by 
      palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine or dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine. We found that 
      after initial enzyme contact with the membrane, a network of hydrogen bonds was 
      formed. This led to deformation of the interacting leaflet and dint formation. The 
      bilayer response to the deformation depended on its phase state. In a gel-phase 
      bilayer, diffusion of lipids is restricted therefore chain melting occurred in both 
      leaflets of the bilayer. In the case of a fluid-phase bilayer, lateral diffusion is 
      possible, and lipid polar head groups were excluded from the contact area. As a 
      result, the bilayer became thinner and a large hydrophobic area was formed. We 
      assume that relative ability of a bilayer to come through lipid redistribution 
      process defines the rate of initial stages of the catalysis.

AB  - The antivenom production against poisonous creatures encounters a number of 
      difficulties. Interestingly, according to the network theory the conventional 
      antigens are not necessarily needed for producing antibodies against the venoms. In 
      this investigation, the antivenom against Mesobuthus eupeus venom was produced based 
      on the aforementioned theory. Polyclonal antibodies against M. eupeus venom were 
      obtained from the immunized rabbits and the specific antibodies were isolated. After 
      separation of Fab2, immunization process and production of the monovalent and 
      anti-idiotype, these antivenoms were analyzed for the determination of their 
      neutralizing power. The level of the produced antibodies in different stages of this 
      study was also measured by ELISA assay. Four hundred and fifty micrograms of the 
      venom can be neutralized by 4.2, 18 and 291 mg of monovalent, polyvalent and 
      anti-idiotype antivenom, respectively. The ELISA results revealed that idiotypic 
      antigens were six times more immunogenic than anti-idiotypes. The anti-idiotype 
      antivenom can be produced on a large scale with minimum venom consumption. In 
      addition, they are non-toxicant in immunized animals and can be used as a vaccine in 
      people at the risk of scorpion stings.

TI  - NMDA receptor membrane dynamics tunes the firing pattern of midbrain dopaminergic 
      neurons.
PG  - 2933-2951
LID - 10.1113/JP281104 [doi]
AB  - KEY POINTS: NMDA receptors (NMDARs) expressed by dopamine neurons of the ventral 
      tegmental area (VTA) play a central role in glutamate synapse plasticity, neuronal 
      firing and adaptative behaviours. The NMDAR surface dynamics shapes synaptic 
      adaptation in hippocampal networks, as well as associative memory. We investigated 
      the basic properties and role of the NMDAR surface dynamics on cultured 
      mesencephalic and VTA dopamine neurons in rodents. Using a combination of single 
      molecule imaging and electrophysiological recordings, we demonstrate that NMDARs are 
      highly diffusive at the surface of mesencephalic dopamine neurons. Unexpectedly, the 
      NMDAR membrane dynamics per se regulates the firing pattern of VTA dopaminergic 
      neurons, probably through a functional interplay between NMDARs receptors and 
      small-conductance calcium-dependent potassium (SK) channels. ABSTRACT: Midbrain 
      dopaminergic (DA) neurons play a central role in major physiological brain 
      functions, and their dysfunctions have been associated with neuropsychiatric 
      diseases. The activity of midbrain DA neurons is controlled by ion channels and 
      neurotransmitter receptors, such as the glutamate NMDA receptor (NMDAR) and 
      small-conductance calcium-dependent potassium (SK) channels. However, the cellular 
      mechanisms through which these channels tune the firing pattern of midbrain DA 
      neurons remain unclear. Here, we investigated whether the surface dynamics and 
      distribution of NMDARs tunes the firing pattern of midbrain DA neurons. Using a 
      combination of single molecule imaging and electrophysiological recordings, we 
      report that NMDARs are highly diffusive at the surface of cultured midbrain DA 
      neurons from rodents and humans. Reducing acutely the NMDAR membrane dynamics, which 
      leaves the ionotropic function of the receptor intact, robustly altered the firing 
      pattern of midbrain DA neurons without altering synaptic glutamatergic transmission. 
      The reduction of NMDAR surface dynamics reduced apamin (SK channel blocker)-induced 
      firing change and the distribution of SK3 channels in DA neurons. Together, these 
      data show that the surface dynamics of NMDAR, and not solely its ionotropic 
      function, tune the firing pattern of midbrain DA neurons partly through a functional 
      interplay with SK channel function.

AB  - Currently, quantifying β-cell mass (BCM) requires harvesting the pancreas. In this 
      study, we investigated a potential noninvasive method to quantify BCM changes 
      longitudinally using [Lys(12)((111)In-BnDTPA-Ahx)]exendin-4 ([(111)In]-Ex4) and 
      single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). We used autoradiography and 
      transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein under the control of mouse 
      insulin 1 gene promotor to evaluate the specificity of [(111)In]-Ex4 toward β cells. 
      Using nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, we injected [(111)In]-Ex4 (3.0 MBq) 
      intravenously and performed SPECT 30 min later, repeating this at a 2-wk interval. 
      After the second scan, we harvested the pancreas and calculated BCM from 
      immunohistochemically stained pancreatic sections. Specific accumulation of 
      [(111)In]-Ex4 in β cells was confirmed by autoradiography, with a significant 
      correlation (r = 0.94) between the fluorescent and radioactive signal intensities. 
      The radioactive signal from the pancreas in the second SPECT scan significantly 
      correlated (r = 0.89) with BCM calculated from the immunostained pancreatic 
      sections. We developed a regression formula to estimate BCM from the radioactive 
      signals from the pancreas in SPECT scans. BCM can be quantified longitudinally and 
      noninvasively by SPECT imaging with [(111)In]-Ex4. This technique successfully 
      demonstrated longitudinal changes in BCM in NOD mice before and after onset of 
      hyperglycemia.-Fujita, N., Fujimoto, H., Hamamatsu, K., Murakami, T., Kimura, H.,

TI  - [Emerging roles of phospholipase A2s in mast cell biology].
PG  - 1179-89
AB  -   Tissue-resident mast cells are derived from circulating committed progenitors, 
      which are originated from pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells in bone marrow. These 
      progenitors migrate into extravascular tissues, where they undergo differentiation 
      and maturation into tissue-specific mast cell phenotypes. When activated by antigen 
      or microenvironmental factors, mast cells release various biologically active 
      products, including pre-formed mediators stored in secretory granules, de novo 
      synthesized lipid mediators, and newly transcribed cytokines and chemokines, thereby 
      promoting anaphylactic inflammation as well as other acute and chronic inflammatory 
      diseases. Here, I will highlight the newest understanding of the phospholipase A2 
      (PLA2)-driven lipid networks in the maturation and effector functions of mast cells 
      and attendant allergic responses. Group III secreted PLA2, the sole mammalian 
      homolog of the potent extrinsic anaphylaxis inducer bee venom PLA2, regulates mast 
      cell maturation through the paracrine prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) circuit. While 
      cytosolic PLA2α is essential for the generation of PGD2 and leukotriene C4 by mast 
      cells, it is also functionally coupled, through the arachidonic acid transfer 
      mechanism, with PGE2 synthase in stromal fibroblasts to provide anti-anaphylactic 
      PGE2. In addition, the roles of two particular mast cell maturation-responsible 
      genes, NDRG1 and NLRP3, in mast cells will be discussed.

AB  - Conotoxins are small disulfide-rich peptide toxins, which have the exceptional 
      diversity of sequences. Because conotoxins are able to specifically bind to ion 
      channels and interfere with neurotransmission, they are considered as the excellent 
      pharmacological candidates in drug design. Appropriate type assignment of newly 
      sequenced mature ion channel-targeted conotoxins with computational method is 
      conducive to explore the biological and pharmacological functions of conotoxins. In 
      this paper, we developed a novel method based on binomial distribution and radial 
      basis function network to predict the types of ion-channel targeted conotoxins. We 
      achieved the overall accuracy of 89.3% with average accuracy of 89.7% in the 
      prediction of three types of ion channel-targeted conotoxins in jackknife 
      cross-validation test, indicating that the method is superior to other 
      state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we evaluated the proposed model with an 
      independent dataset including 77 conotoxins. The overall accuracy of 85.7% was 
      achieved, validating that our model is reliable. Moreover, we used the proposed 
      method to annotate 336 function-undefined mature conotoxins in the UniProt Database. 
      The model provides the valuable instructions for theoretical and experimental 
      research on conotoxins.

TI  - The pharmacology of mechanogated membrane ion channels.
PG  - 231-52
AB  - In this article, the actions, mechanisms and applications of various ions and drugs 
      that interact with MG channels have been discussed. At present, no compound has been 
      found that displays the high specificity and affinity exhibited by tetrodotoxin or 
      alpha-bungarotoxin that proved so useful in the functional and structural 
      characterization of the voltage-gated Na+ channel and the acetylcholine receptor 
      channel, respectively. Nevertheless, three different classes of compounds have been 
      discovered since Paintal's review that clearly block MG channels. These compounds, 
      represented by amiloride, gentamicin and gadolinium, act mainly on the SA cation 
      channel, which appears to be shared by many nonsensory and some mechanosensory 
      cells. Each class of compound can be distinguished by the voltage and concentration 
      dependence of the block and most likely involves different mechanisms of blocking 
      action. In general, the MG channel blocker pharmacology indicates a variety of 
      "receptor sites" on MG channels. The recognition and acceptance of such receptors 
      should provide added impetus for continued screening for more potent drugs, venoms 
      and toxins. In the case of activators, little is understood of the mechanisms by 
      which the various amphipathic and amphiphilic compounds stimulate MG channels, 
      although different bilayer and protein mechanisms have been evoked. Even less is 
      understood of the role the new class of MG K+ channel and their modulation by fatty 
      acids plays in physiological and perhaps pathological processes. However, given that 
      K+ channels in general tend to reduce the excitability of nerve and muscle, 
      plausible roles include fatty acid regulation of vascular tone and control of 
      neuronal network excitability. In both cases, more detailed understanding is 
      required regarding the physiological stimuli that modulate these channels through 
      their fatty acid receptors. It may turn out that recognition and/or development of 
      cell-type specific agents that activate such MG channels will possess high 
      therapeutic potential. In any case, the observation that MG channels can be 
      chemically blocked and/or activated by a wide range of compounds requires revision 
      of the long-standing conclusion of Paintal that mechanotransduction is a process 
      that has a low susceptibility to chemical influence.

AB  - The worrisome emergence of pathogens resistant to conventional drugs has stimulated 
      the search for new classes of antimicrobial and antiparasitic agents from natural 
      sources. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), acting through mechanisms that do not rely 
      on the interaction with a specific receptor, provide new possibilities for the 
      development of drugs against resistant organisms. This study sought to purify and 
      proteomically characterize the antimicrobial and antiparasitic peptidomes of B. 
      atrox and B. jararacussu snake venoms against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, 
      Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-MRSA), Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, 
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria, and the protozoan parasites 
      Leishmania amazonensis and Plasmodium falciparum (clone W2, resistant to 
      chloroquine). To this end, B. atrox and B. jararacussu venom peptides were purified 
      by combination of 3 kDa cut-off Amicon(®) ultracentrifugal filters and reverse-phase 
      high-performance liquid chromatography, and then identified by 
      electrospray-ionization Ion-Trap/Time-of-Flight mass spectrometry. Fourteen distinct 
      peptides, with masses ranging from 443.17 to 1383.73 Da and primary structure 
      between 3 and 13 amino acid residues, were sequenced. Among them, 13 contained 
      unique sequences, including 4 novel bradykinin-potentiating-like peptides (BPPs), 
      and a snake venom metalloproteinase tripeptide inhibitor (SVMPi). Although commonly 
      found in Viperidae venoms, except for Bax-12, the BPPs and SVMPi here reported had 
      not been described in B. atrox and B. jararacussu venoms. Among the novel peptides, 
      some exhibited bactericidal activity towards P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, had low 
      hemolytic effect, and were devoid of antiparasitic activity. The identified novel 
      antimicrobial peptides may be relevant in the development of new drugs for the 
      management of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.

AB  - As harmful algal blooms (HABs) increase in magnitude and duration worldwide, they 
      are becoming an expanding threat to marine wildlife. Over the past decade, blooms of 
      algae that produce the neurotoxins domoic acid (DA) and saxitoxin (STX) and 
      documented concurrent seabird mortality events have increased bicoastally in the 
      United States. We conducted a retrospective analysis of HAB related mortality events 
      in California, Washington, and Rhode Island between 2007 and 2018 involving 12 
      species of seabirds, to document the levels, ranges, and patterns of DA and STX in 
      eight sample types (kidney, liver, stomach, intestinal, cloacal, cecal contents, 
      bile, blood) collected from birds during these events. Samples (n = 182) from 83 
      birds were examined for DA (n = 135) or STX (n = 17) or both toxins simultaneously 
      (n = 30), using ELISA or LCMS at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric 
      Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA-NMFS) Wildlife Algal-toxin 
      Research and Response Network (WARRN-West) or the University of California, Santa 
      Cruz (UCSC). DA or STX was detected in seven of the sample types with STX below the 
      minimum detection limit in blood for the three samples tested. DA was found in 70% 
      and STX was found in 23% of all tested samples. The ranges of detectable levels of 
      DA and STX in all samples were 0.65-681,190.00 ng g(-1) and 2.00-20.95 ng g(-1), 
      respectively. Cloacal contents from a Pacific loon (Gavia pacifica) collected in 
      2017 from Ventura County, California, had the highest maximum level of DA for all 
      samples and species tested in this study. The highest level of STX for all samples 
      and species was detected in the bile of a northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis) 
      collected in 2018 from San Luis Obispo County, California. DA detections were 
      consistently found in gastrointestinal samples, liver, bile, and kidney, whereas STX 
      detections were most frequently seen in liver and bile samples. Co-occurring HAB 
      toxins (DA and STX) were detected in white-winged scoters (Melanitta deglandi) in 
      2009, a Brandt's cormorant (Phalacrocorax penicillatus) in 2015, and a northern 
      fulmar and common murre (Uria aalge) in 2018. This article provides DA and STX 
      tissue concentrations and patterns in avian samples and shows the utility of various 
      sample types for the detection of HAB toxins. Future research to understand the 
      pharmacodynamics of these toxins in avian species and to establish lethal doses in 
      various bird species would be beneficial.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the productivity and visibility in research, clinical studies, 
      treatment, use and production of antivenoms against poisonous snakes, scorpions and 
      spiders. METHODS: Bibliometric analysis of research and other activities. Articles 
      on venoms and antivenoms published between 2000 and 2020 were retrieved from the 
      Scopus database. The records were analyzed by bibliometric indicators including 
      number of documents per year, journals, authors, and citation frequency. 
      VOSviewer(®) v.1.6.13 was used to construct bibliometric networks for country 
      co-authorships and co-occurrence of terms. RESULTS: Australia, Brazil, Costa Rica 
      and India were among the six top countries with most documents and were selected for 
      more detailed analysis. Costa Rica was the country with the largest percentage of 
      its publications dedicated to antivenom production and venomics. Only a few papers 
      dealt with the issues of quality, safety, and efficacy of antivenoms or the role of 
      the national regulatory authorities. The use of VOSviewer (®) allowed visualization 
      through joint publications of networking between countries. Visualization by 
      co-occurrence of terms showed differences in the research carried out. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Working in a collaborative and coordinated manner these four countries could have a 
      major impact on envenoming globally. Attention should be given not only to antivenom 
      production but also to strengthening regulatory oversight of antivenom products.

LID - 10.1073/pnas.1908903116 [doi]
AB  - Voltage-dependent potassium channels (K(v)s) gate in response to changes in 
      electrical membrane potential by coupling a voltage-sensing module with a 
      K(+)-selective pore. Animal toxins targeting K(v)s are classified as pore blockers, 
      which physically plug the ion conduction pathway, or as gating modifiers, which 
      disrupt voltage sensor movements. A third group of toxins blocks K(+) conduction by 
      an unknown mechanism via binding to the channel turrets. Here, we show that 
      Conkunitzin-S1 (Cs1), a peptide toxin isolated from cone snail venom, binds at the 
      turrets of K(v)1.2 and targets a network of hydrogen bonds that govern water access 
      to the peripheral cavities that surround the central pore. The resulting ectopic 
      water flow triggers an asymmetric collapse of the pore by a process resembling that 
      of inherent slow inactivation. Pore modulation by animal toxins exposes the 
      peripheral cavity of K(+) channels as a novel pharmacological target and provides a 
      rational framework for drug design.

      phospholipase A2 superfamily (PLA2s): Insights into the structure-function 
      relationships of snake venom toxins.

AB  - Phospholipases A2 (PLA(2)s) comprise a superfamily of glycerophospholipids 
      hydrolyzing enzymes present in many organisms in nature, whose catalytic activity 
      was majorly unveiled by analysis of snake venoms. The latter have pharmaceutical and 
      biotechnological interests and can be divided into different functional sub-classes. 
      Our goal was to identify important residues and their relation to the functional and 
      class-specific characteristics in the PLA(2)s family with special emphasis on snake 
      venom PLA(2)s (svPLA(2)s). We identified such residues by conservation analysis and 
      decomposition of residue coevolution networks (DRCN), annotated the results based on 
      the available literature on PLA(2)s, structural analysis and molecular dynamics 
      simulations, and related the results to the phylogenetic distribution of these 
      proteins. A filtered alignment of PLA(2)s revealed 14 highly conserved positions and 
      3 sets of coevolved residues, which were annotated according to their structural or 
      functional role. These residues are mostly involved in ligand binding and catalysis, 
      calcium-binding, the formation of disulfide bridges and a hydrophobic cluster close 
      to the binding site. An independent validation of the inference of 
      structure-function relationships from our co-evolution analysis on the svPLA2s 
      family was obtained by the analysis of the pattern of selection acting on the 
      Viperidae and Elapidae lineages. Additionally, a molecular dynamics simulation on 
      the Lys49 PLA(2) from Agkistrodon contortrix laticinctus was carried out to further 
      investigate the correlation of the Lys49-Glu69 pair. Our results suggest this 
      configuration can result in a novel conformation where the binding cavity collapses 
      due to the approximation of two loops caused by a strong salt bridge between Glu69 
      and Arg34. Finally, phylogenetic analysis indicated a correlation between the 
      presence of residues in the coevolved sets found in this analysis and the clade 
      localization. The results provide a guide for important positions in the family of 
      PLA(2)s, and potential new objects of investigation.

AB  - Accurate and controllable regulatory elements such as promoters and ribosome binding 
      sites (RBSs) are indispensable tools to quantitatively regulate gene expression for 
      rational pathway engineering. Therefore, de novo designing regulatory elements is 
      brought back to the forefront of synthetic biology research. Here we developed a 
      quantitative design method for regulatory elements based on strength prediction 
      using artificial neural network (ANN). One hundred mutated Trc promoter & RBS 
      sequences, which were finely characterized with a strength distribution from 0 to 
      3.559 (relative to the strength of the original sequence which was defined as 1), 
      were used for model training and test. A precise strength prediction model, 
      NET90_19_576, was finally constructed with high regression correlation coefficients 
      of 0.98 for both model training and test. Sixteen artificial elements were in silico 
      designed using this model. All of them were proved to have good consistency between 
      the measured strength and our desired strength. The functional reliability of the 
      designed elements was validated in two different genetic contexts. The designed 
      parts were successfully utilized to improve the expression of BmK1 peptide toxin and 
      fine-tune deoxy-xylulose phosphate pathway in Escherichia coli. Our results 
      demonstrate that the methodology based on ANN model can de novo and quantitatively 
      design regulatory elements with desired strengths, which are of great importance for 
      synthetic biology applications.

AB  - Snakebite incidence at least partly depends on the biology of the snakes involved. 
      However, studies of snake biology have been largely neglected in favour of anthropic 
      factors, with the exception of taxonomy, which has been recognised for some decades 
      to affect the design of antivenoms. Despite this, within-species venom variation and 
      the unpredictability of the correlation with antivenom cross-reactivity has 
      continued to be problematic. Meanwhile, other aspects of snake biology, including 
      behaviour, spatial ecology and activity patterns, distribution, and population 
      demography, which can contribute to snakebite mitigation and prevention, remain 
      underfunded and understudied. Here, we review the literature relevant to these 
      aspects of snakebite and illustrate how demographic, spatial, and behavioural 
      studies can improve our understanding of why snakebites occur and provide evidence 
      for prevention strategies. We identify the large gaps that remain to be filled and 
      urge that, in the future, data and relevant metadata be shared openly via public 
      data repositories so that studies can be properly replicated and data used in future 
      meta-analyses.

AB  - Acetylcholine (ACh) is well known to be involved in the control of breathing. 
      However, no information is available on the role of ACh receptors (AChRs) within the 
      lamprey respiratory network. The present study was performed on in vitro brainstem 
      preparations of adult lampreys to investigate whether ACh affects respiratory 
      activity possibly through an action on the paratrigeminal respiratory group (pTRG) 
      that has been identified as an essential component of the respiratory network. 
      Respiratory activity was monitored as vagal motor output. Bath application of 100 μM 
      physostigmine or 1 μM nicotine increased respiratory frequency, while bath 
      application of 100 μM D-tubocurarine or 0.25 μM α-bungarotoxin reduced respiratory 
      frequency and increased the duration of vagal bursts. Since these effects were 
      mimicked by microinjections of the same drugs into the pTRG, ACh proved to influence 
      respiratory activity by acting on α7 nicotinic AChRs located within the pTRG. During 
      apnea caused by partial blockade of ionotropic glutamate receptors at the level of 
      the pTRG, bath application of bicuculline and strychnine restored the respiratory 
      rhythm, although at reduced frequency. Similar results were obtained by the 
      concurrent removal of both fast synaptic excitatory and inhibitory transmission. 
      Blockade of pTRG α7 nicotinic AChRs suppressed this respiratory activity, thus 
      indicating that pTRG neurons expressing these receptors contribute to respiratory 
      rhythm generation. Together, these findings identify a novel cholinergic modulatory 
      and possibly subsidiary rhythmogenic mechanism within the respiratory network of the 
      adult lamprey and encourage further studies on the respiratory role of cholinergic 
      receptors in different animal species.

TI  - High throughput quantitative expression screening and purification applied to 
      recombinant disulfide-rich venom proteins produced in E. coli.
PG  - e51464

LID - 51464
AB  - Escherichia coli (E. coli) is the most widely used expression system for the 
      production of recombinant proteins for structural and functional studies. However, 
      purifying proteins is sometimes challenging since many proteins are expressed in an 
      insoluble form. When working with difficult or multiple targets it is therefore 
      recommended to use high throughput (HTP) protein expression screening on a small 
      scale (1-4 ml cultures) to quickly identify conditions for soluble expression. To 
      cope with the various structural genomics programs of the lab, a quantitative 
      (within a range of 0.1-100 mg/L culture of recombinant protein) and HTP protein 
      expression screening protocol was implemented and validated on thousands of 
      proteins. The protocols were automated with the use of a liquid handling robot but 
      can also be performed manually without specialized equipment. Disulfide-rich venom 
      proteins are gaining increasing recognition for their potential as therapeutic drug 
      leads. They can be highly potent and selective, but their complex disulfide bond 
      networks make them challenging to produce. As a member of the FP7 European Venomics 
      project (www.venomics.eu), our challenge is to develop successful production 
      strategies with the aim of producing thousands of novel venom proteins for 
      functional characterization. Aided by the redox properties of disulfide bond 
      isomerase DsbC, we adapted our HTP production pipeline for the expression of 
      oxidized, functional venom peptides in the E. coli cytoplasm. The protocols are also 
      applicable to the production of diverse disulfide-rich proteins. Here we demonstrate 
      our pipeline applied to the production of animal venom proteins. With the protocols 
      described herein it is likely that soluble disulfide-rich proteins will be obtained 
      in as little as a week. Even from a small scale, there is the potential to use the

AB  - Conotoxins are short, cysteine-rich peptides of great interest as novel therapeutic 
      leads and of great concern as lethal biological agents due to their high affinity 
      and specificity for various receptors involved in neuromuscular transmission. 
      Currently, of the approximately 6000 known conotoxin sequences, only about 3% have 
      associated structural characterization, which leads to a bottleneck in rapid 
      high-throughput screening (HTS) for identification of potential leads or threats. In 
      this work, we combine a graph-based approach with homology modeling to expand the 
      library of conotoxin structures and to identify those conotoxin sequences that are 
      of the greatest value for experimental structural characterization. The latter would 
      allow for the rapid expansion of the known structural space for generating high 
      quality template-based models. Our approach generalizes to other 
      evolutionarily-related, short, cysteine-rich venoms of interest. Overall, we present 
      and validate an approach for venom structure modeling and experimental guidance and 
      employ it to produce a 290%-larger library of approximate conotoxin structures for 
      HTS. We also provide a set of ranked conotoxin sequences for experimental structure 
      determination to further expand this library.

PG  - 1063-79
AB  - Integrative properties of single neurons have been extensively studied in acute 
      brain slices. However, these preparations are characterized by extremely low levels 
      of synaptic and action potential activity. In comparison to in vivo, reduced 
      intracortical input and lack of subcortical modulation increase the effective 
      difference between mean membrane potential and spiking threshold, preventing 
      self-sustained network activity in vitro. To elicit an increased and stable network 
      activity (INA) in vitro comparable to that found in awake animals, we mimicked 
      subcortical cholinergic and serotoninergic inputs using carbachol or barium alone or 
      in combination with serotonin in layer 5 pyramidal cells in slices of mouse 
      somatosensory cortex. INA is primarily induced by a modulation of intrinsic 
      conductances resulting in a depolarization of the membrane potential. We studied the 
      impact of INA on synaptic and somatodendritic integration using extracellular 
      stimulation and dendritic calcium imaging. Synaptic inhibition is strengthened due 
      to an increased driving force for chloride. The critical frequency at which somatic 
      action potentials induce a dendritic calcium action potential is lowered. 
      Simultaneous inhibitory synaptic input is powerful enough to suppress dendritic 
      calcium action potential generation. Pharmacologically induced INA enables the study 
      of neuronal integration in well-accessible cortical slices within an active network.

TI  - New Insights into the Type II Toxins from the Sea Anemone Heteractis crispa.
LID - 10.3390/toxins12010044 [doi]
LID - 44
AB  - Toxins modulating Na(V) channels are the most abundant and studied peptide 
      components of sea anemone venom. Three type-II toxins, δ-SHTX-Hcr1f (= RpII), 
      RTX-III, and RTX-VI, were isolated from the sea anemone Heteractis crispa. RTX-VI 
      has been found to be an unusual analog of RTX-III. The electrophysiological effects 
      of Heteractis toxins on nine Na(V) subtypes were investigated for the first time. 
      Heteractis toxins mainly affect the inactivation of the mammalian Na(V) channels 
      expressed in the central nervous system (Na(V)1.1-Na(V)1.3, Na(V)1.6) as well as 
      insect and arachnid channels (BgNa(V)1, VdNa(V)1). The absence of Arg13 in the 
      RTX-VI structure does not prevent toxin binding with the channel but it has changed 
      its pharmacological profile and potency. According to computer modeling data, the 
      δ-SHTX-Hcr1f binds within the extracellular region of the rNa(V)1.2 voltage-sensing 
      domain IV and pore-forming domain I through a network of strong interactions, and an 
      additional fixation of the toxin at the channel binding site is carried out through 
      the phospholipid environment. Our data suggest that Heteractis toxins could be used 
      as molecular tools for Na(V) channel studies or insecticides rather than as 
      pharmacological agents.

TI  - Transcriptome and coexpression network analysis of the human glioma cell line Hs683 
      exposed to candoxin.
PG  - 887-98
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Gliomas are the most common primary tumours of the central nervous 
      system. Snake venom, such as candoxin (CDX) isolated from Bungarus candidus, 
      inhibits glioma cell proliferation. This study explored the gene regulation profile 
      of CDX-treated human glioma Hs683 cells. METHODS: Using microarray technology and 
      bioinformatics analyses the underlying molecular mechanism of action of CDX was 
      evaluated by constructing gene regulation and protein-protein interaction co 
      expression networks. RESULTS: CDX treatment induced a large number of related genes 
      at the transcriptional level. The MYC gene (v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene 
      homologue [avian]) had a key role in the response of Hs683 cells to CDX treatment. 
      Activation of MYC upregulated NDRG1 (N-myc downstream regulated 1), WNT10B 
      (wingless-type mouse mammary tumour virus integration site family, member 10B), 
      CASP9 (caspase 9, apoptosis-related cysteine peptidase) and CDKN2A (cyclin-dependent 
      kinase inhibitor 2A), and downregulated ID3 (inhibitor of DNA binding 3, dominant 
      negative helix-loop-helix protein) and SLC1A4 (solute carrier family 1 
      [glutamate/neutral amino acid transporter], member 4). In addition, a subnetwork was 
      constructed among SPP1 (secreted phosphoprotein 1), SDC1 (syndecan 1) and CD44 based 
      on protein-protein interactions, and these genes were predicted to be involved in 
      glioma cell invasion. CONCLUSION: These findings might provide novel therapeutic 
      targets for glioma chemotherapy.

TI  - Motor recovery and synaptic preservation after ventral root avulsion and repair with 
      a fibrin sealant derived from snake venom.
PG  - e63260
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0063260 [doi]
LID - e63260
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventral root avulsion is an experimental model of proximal axonal injury 
      at the central/peripheral nervous system interface that results in paralysis and 
      poor clinical outcome after restorative surgery. Root reimplantation may decrease 
      neuronal degeneration in such cases. We describe the use of a snake venom-derived 
      fibrin sealant during surgical reconnection of avulsed roots at the spinal cord 
      surface. The present work investigates the effects of this fibrin sealant on 
      functional recovery, neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity, and glial reaction in 
      the spinal motoneuron microenvironment after ventral root reimplantation. 
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Female Lewis rats (7 weeks old) were subjected to 
      VRA and root replantation. The animals were divided into two groups: 1) avulsion 
      only and 2) replanted roots with fibrin sealant derived from snake venom. 
      Post-surgical motor performance was evaluated using the CatWalk system twice a week 
      for 12 weeks. The rats were sacrificed 12 weeks after surgery, and their lumbar 
      intumescences were processed for motoneuron counting and immunohistochemistry (GFAP, 
      Iba-1 and synaptophysin antisera). Array based qRT-PCR was used to evaluate gene 
      regulation of several neurotrophic factors and receptors as well as inflammatory 
      related molecules. The results indicated that the root reimplantation with fibrin 
      sealant enhanced motor recovery, preserved the synaptic covering of the motoneurons 
      and improved neuronal survival. The replanted group did not show significant changes 
      in microglial response compared to VRA-only. However, the astroglial reaction was 
      significantly reduced in this group. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In conclusion, the 
      present data suggest that the repair of avulsed roots with snake venom fibrin glue 
      at the exact point of detachment results in neuroprotection and preservation of the 
      synaptic network at the microenvironment of the lesioned motoneurons. Also such 
      procedure reduced the astroglial reaction and increased mRNA levels to neurotrophins 
      and anti-inflammatory cytokines that may in turn, contribute to improving recovery 
      of motor function.

AB  - This paper presents a novel serine protease (SP) isolated from Bothrops pirajai, a 
      venomous snake found solely in Brazil that belongs to the Viperidae family. The 
      identified SP, named BpirSP-39, was isolated by three chromatographic steps (size 
      exclusion, bioaffinity, and reverse phase chromatographies). The molecular mass of 
      BpirSP-39 was estimated by SDS-PAGE and confirmed by mass spectrometry (39,408.32 
      Da). The protein was able to form fibrin networks, which was not observed in the 
      presence of serine protease inhibitors, such as phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 
      (PMSF). Furthermore, BpirSP-39 presented considerable thermal stability and was 
      apparently able to activate factor XIII of the blood coagulation cascade, unlike 
      most serine proteases. BpirSP-39 was capable of hydrolyzing different chromogenic 
      substrates tested (S-2222, S-2302, and S-2238) while Cu(2+) significantly diminished 
      BspirSP-39 activity on the three tested substrates. The enzyme promoted platelet 
      aggregation and also exhibited fibrinogenolytic, fibrinolytic, gelatinolytic, and 
      amidolytic activities. The multiple alignment showed high sequence similarity to 
      other thrombin-like enzymes from snake venoms. These results allow us to conclude 
      that a new SP was isolated from Bothrops pirajai snake venom.

TI  - Electrophysiological Evaluation of Pacific Oyster (Crassostrea gigas) Sensitivity to 
      Saxitoxin and Tetrodotoxin.
LID - 10.3390/md19070380 [doi]
LID - 380
AB  - Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) may bio-accumulate high levels of paralytic 
      shellfish toxins (PST) during harmful algal blooms of the genus Alexandrium. These 
      blooms regularly occur in coastal waters, affecting oyster health and marketability. 
      The aim of our study was to analyse the PST-sensitivity of nerves of Pacific oysters 
      in relation with toxin bio-accumulation. The results show that C. gigas nerves have 
      micromolar range of saxitoxin (STX) sensitivity, thus providing intermediate STX 
      sensitivity compared to other bivalve species. However, theses nerves were much less 
      sensitive to tetrodotoxin. The STX-sensitivity of compound nerve action potential 
      (CNAP) recorded from oysters experimentally fed with Alexandrium minutum 
      (toxic-alga-exposed oysters), or Tisochrysis lutea, a non-toxic microalga (control 
      oysters), revealed that oysters could be separated into STX-resistant and 
      STX-sensitive categories, regardless of the diet. Moreover, the percentage of 
      toxin-sensitive nerves was lower, and the STX concentration necessary to inhibit 50% 
      of CNAP higher, in recently toxic-alga-exposed oysters than in control bivalves. 
      However, no obvious correlation was observed between nerve sensitivity to STX and 
      the STX content in oyster digestive glands. None of the nerves isolated from wild 
      and farmed oysters was detected to be sensitive to tetrodotoxin. In conclusion, this 
      study highlights the good potential of cerebrovisceral nerves of Pacific oysters for 
      electrophysiological and pharmacological studies. In addition, this study shows, for 
      the first time, that C. gigas nerves have micromolar range of STX sensitivity. The 
      STX sensitivity decreases, at least temporary, upon recent oyster exposure to 
      dinoflagellates producing PST under natural, but not experimental environment.

TI  - A Deep Learning Approach with Data Augmentation to Predict Novel Spider Neurotoxic 
      Peptides.
LID - 10.3390/ijms222212291 [doi]
LID - 12291
AB  - As major components of spider venoms, neurotoxic peptides exhibit structural 
      diversity, target specificity, and have great pharmaceutical potential. Deep 
      learning may be an alternative to the laborious and time-consuming methods for 
      identifying these peptides. However, the major hurdle in developing a deep learning 
      model is the limited data on neurotoxic peptides. Here, we present a peptide data 
      augmentation method that improves the recognition of neurotoxic peptides via a 
      convolutional neural network model. The neurotoxic peptides were augmented with the 
      known neurotoxic peptides from UniProt database, and the models were trained using a 
      training set with or without the generated sequences to verify the augmented data. 
      The model trained with the augmented dataset outperformed the one with the 
      unaugmented dataset, achieving accuracy of 0.9953, precision of 0.9922, recall of 
      0.9984, and F1 score of 0.9953 in simulation dataset. From the set of all RNA 
      transcripts of Callobius koreanus spider, we discovered neurotoxic peptides via the 
      model, resulting in 275 putative peptides of which 252 novel sequences and only 23 
      sequences showing homology with the known peptides by Basic Local Alignment Search 
      Tool. Among these 275 peptides, four were selected and shown to have neuromodulatory 
      effects on the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y. The augmentation method 
      presented here may be applied to the identification of other functional peptides 
      from biological resources with insufficient data.

TI  - Origin and function of supporting cells in the venom glands of the lesser weeverfish 
      (Trachinus vipera).
PG  - 287-95
AB  - Supporting cells in the venom glands of Trachinus vipera form a network whose meshes 
      are filled with developed glandular cells. These supporting cells are derived from 
      epidermal cells. A connective tissue sheath forms inside the gland, separating it 
      into pockets. A basal lamina surrounding the pockets between the connective tissue 
      and supporting cells can be observed similar to that between connective tissue and 
      epidermis. The pockets are probably formed by epidermal invagination. In view of the 
      ultrastructural observations, the supporting cells not only maintain the 
      cohesiveness of the venom gland, as demonstrated by the presence of numerous 
      interdigitations and desmosomes, but may also play a role in the regeneration of 
      large glandular cells.

TI  - Helios negative Regulatory T-cells as a key factor of immune tolerance in 
      non-allergic beekeepers.
PG  - 0
LID - 10.18176/jiaci.0722 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Background: Although exposure to stings has been 
      identified as the leading risk factor for anaphylaxis due to Hymenoptera venom 
      allergy, professional beekeepers receive hundreds yearly without developing systemic 
      reactions. Objective: This study aims to analyse the mechanisms underlying bee venom 
      tolerance in beekeepers. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted. 
      Participants were recruited and classified into three groups: allergic patients (AP) 
      experiencing systemic reactions after bee stings, with a positive intradermal test 
      and specific IgE (sIgE) to Apis mellifera venom (AmV); tolerant beekeepers (TBK) 
      receiving ≥50 stings/year; and healthy non-exposed controls (HC). Serum levels of 
      sIgE and specific IgG4 (sIgG4) to AmV, rApi m 1, rApi m 2, rApi m 3, Api m 4, rApi m 
      5 and rApi m10, as well as AmV-induced basophil degranulation, percentage of T-cell 
      subsets, regulatory T-cells (Treg cells) and IL-10 production, were measured. 
      RESULTS: APs had high levels of sIgE to AmV and all its allergic components 
      (p<0.001) together with a high basophil activation rate (p<0.001) compared to TBKs. 
      Conversely, compared to APs, TBKs showed higher levels of sIgG4 (p<0.001) and IL-10 
      (p<0.001) as well as an enhanced CTLA-4+ Treg population (p=0.001), expanded Helios- 
      Treg (p<0.003), and reduced T-helper 1 (p=0.008), T-helper 2 (p=0.004) and T-helper 
      17 (p=0.007) subsets. CONCLUSIONS: A different profile, strongly marked by Treg 
      activity, was found in TBKs. This natural tolerance would be led by the expansion of 
      inducible Helios-Treg cells at a peripheral level. Helios-Treg population could be a 
      novel candidate biomarker useful for monitoring tolerance.

      piscivorus leucostoma snake venom.

AB  - Phospholipases A(2) (PLA(2)s) constitute a class of extensively studied toxins, 
      isolated from snake venoms. Basic PLA(2) isoforms mediate various toxicological 
      effects, while the acidic isoforms generally have higher enzymatic activities, but 
      do not promote evident toxic effects. The functions of these acidic isoforms in 
      snake venoms are still not completely understood and more studies are needed to 
      characterize the biological functions and diversification of acidic toxins in order 
      to justify their abundant presence in these secretions. Recently, Lomonte and 
      collaborators demonstrated, in a proteomic and toxicological study, high 
      concentrations of PLA(2)s in the venom of Agkistrodon piscivorus leucostoma. We 
      have, herein, purified and characterized an acidic PLA(2) from this snake venom, 
      denominated AplTx-I, in order to better understand its biochemical and structural 
      characteristics, as well as its biological effects. AplTx-I was purified using two 
      chromatographic steps, in association with enzymatic and biological assays. The 
      acidic toxin was found to be one of the most abundant proteins in the venom of A. p. 
      leucostoma; the protein was monomeric with a molecular mass of 13,885.8 Da, as 
      identified by mass spectrometry ESI-TOF and electrophoresis. The toxin has similar 
      primary and tridimensional structures to those of other acidic PLA(2)s, a 
      theoretical and experimental isoelectric point of ≈5.12, and a calcium-dependent 
      enzyme activity of 25.8985 nM/min/mg, with maximum values at 37 °C and pH 8.0. 
      Despite its high enzymatic activity on synthetic substrate, AplTx-I did not induce 
      high or significant myotoxic, coagulant, anticoagulant, edema, neuromuscular 
      toxicity in mouse phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparations or antibacterial activities. 
      Interestingly, AplTx-I triggered a high and selective neuromuscular toxicity in 
      chick biventer cervicis preparations. These findings are relevant to provide a 
      deeper understanding of the pharmacology, role and diversification of acidic 
      phospholipase A(2) isoforms in snake venoms.

TI  - [Impact of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists on nasopharyngitis and upper 
      respiratory tract infection among patients with type 2 diabetes: a network 
      meta-analysis].
PG  - 454-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor 
      agonists (GLP-1RAs) on two common respiratory system adverse events (RSAE: 
      nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection) among type 2 diabetes (T2DM). 
      METHODS: Medline, Embase, Clinical trials and Cochrane library were searched from 
      inception through May 2015 to identify randomized clinical trials(RCTs) assessed 
      safety of GLP-1RAs versus placebo or other anti-diabetic drugs in T2DM. Network 
      meta-analysis within a Bayesian framework was performed to calculate odds ratios for 
      the incidence of RSAE. RESULTS: In the study, 50 RCTs were included, including 13 
      treatments: 7 GLP-1RAs (exenatide, exenatide-long-release-agent, liraglutide, 
      lixisenatide, taspoglutide, albiglutide and dulaglutide), placebo and 5 traditional 
      anti-diabetic drugs(insulin, metformin, sulfonylureas, sitagliptin and 
      thiazolidinediones ketones). Compared with insulin, taspoglutide significantly 
      decreased the incidence of nasopharyngitis (OR=0.67, 95%CI: 0.46-0.96). Significant 
      lowering effects on upper respiratory tract infection were found when taspoglutide 
      versus placebo (OR=0.57, 95%CI: 0.34-0.99) and insulin (OR=0.39, 95%CI: 0.23-0.73). 
      The result from the network meta-analysis based on Bayesian theory could be used to 
      rank all the treatments included, which showed that taspoglutide ranked last with 
      minimum risk on nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection. CONCLUSION: 
      Taspoglutide was associated with significantly lowering effect on RSAE.

TI  - Using a Novel Ontology to Inform the Discovery of Therapeutic Peptides from Animal 
      Venoms.
PG  - 209-18
AB  - Venoms and venom-derived compounds constitute a rich and largely unexplored source 
      of potentially therapeutic compounds. To facilitate biomedical research, it is 
      necessary to design a robust informatics infrastructure that will allow semantic 
      computation of venom concepts in a standardized, consistent manner. We have designed 
      an ontology of venom-related concepts - named Venom Ontology - that reuses an 
      existing public data source: UniProt's Tox-Prot database. In addition to describing 
      the ontology and its construction, we have performed three separate case studies 
      demonstrating its utility: (1) An exploration of venom peptide similarity networks 
      within specific genera; (2) A broad overview of the distribution of available data 
      among common taxonomic groups spanning the known tree of life; and (3) An analysis 
      of the distribution of venom complexity across those same taxonomic groups. Venom 
      Ontology is publicly available on BioPortal at 
      http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/CU-VO.

TI  - Molecular cloning and functional characterization of two isoforms of dermonecrotic 
      toxin from Loxosceles intermedia (brown spider) venom gland.
PG  - 1241-53
AB  - Brown spider (Genus Loxosceles) bites are normally associated with necrotic skin 
      degeneration, gravitational spreading, massive inflammatory response at injured 
      region, platelet aggregation causing thrombocytopenia and renal disturbances. Brown 
      spider venom has a complex composition containing many different toxins, of which a 
      well-studied component is the dermonecrotic toxin. This toxin alone may produce 
      necrotic lesions, inflammatory response and platelet aggregation. Biochemically, 
      dermonecrotic toxin belongs to a family of toxins with 30-35 kDa characterized as 
      sphingomyelinase-D. Here, employing a cDNA library of Loxosceles intermedia venom 
      gland, we cloned and expressed two recombinant isoforms of the dermonecrotic toxin 
      LiRecDT2 (1062 bp cDNA) and LiRecDT3 (1007 bp cDNA) that encode for signal peptides 
      and complete mature proteins. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed a structural 
      relationship for these toxins compared to other members of family. Recombinant 
      molecules were expressed as N-terminal His-tag fusion proteins in Escherichia coli 
      and were purified to homogeneity from cell lysates by Ni(2+) chelating 
      chromatography, resulting in proteins of 33.8 kDa for LiRecDT2 and 34.0 kDa for 
      LiRecDT3. Additional evidence for related toxins containing sequence/epitopes 
      identity comes from antigenic cross-reactivity using antibodies against crude venom 
      toxins and antibodies raised with a purified dermonecrotic toxin. Recombinant toxins 
      showed differential functionality in rabbits: LiRecDT2 caused a macroscopic lesion 
      with gravitational spreading upon intradermal injection, while LiRecDT3 evoked 
      transient swelling and erythema upon injection site. Light microscopic analysis of 
      skin biopsies revealed edema, a collection of inflammatory cells in and around blood 
      vessels and a proteinaceous network at the dermis. Moreover, differential 
      functionality for recombinant toxins was also demonstrated by a high 
      sphingomyelinase activity for LiRecDT2 and low activity for LiRecDT3 as well as 
      greater in vitro platelet aggregation and blood vessel permeability induced by 
      LiRecDT2 and residual activity for LiRecDT3. Cloning and expression of two 
      recombinant dermonecrotic toxins demonstrate an intraspecific family of homologous 
      toxins that act in synergism for deleterious activities of the venom and open 
      possibilities for biotechnological applications for recombinant toxins as research 
      tools for understanding the inflammatory response, vascular integrity and platelet 
      aggregation modulators.

AB  - Muscle regeneration is a dynamic process during which cell state and identity change 
      over time. A major roadblock has been a lack of tools to resolve a myogenic 
      progression in vivo. Here we capitalize on a transformative technology, single-cell 
      mass cytometry (CyTOF), to identify in vivo skeletal muscle stem cell and previously 
      unrecognized progenitor populations that precede differentiation. We discovered two 
      cell surface markers, CD9 and CD104, whose combined expression enabled 
      in vivo identification and prospective isolation of stem and progenitor cells. Data 
      analysis using the X-shift algorithm paired with single-cell force-directed layout 
      visualization defined a molecular signature of the activated stem cell state 
      (CD44(+)/CD98(+)/MyoD(+)) and delineated a myogenic trajectory during recovery from 
      acute muscle injury. Our studies uncover the dynamics of skeletal muscle 
      regeneration in vivo and pave the way for the elucidation of the regulatory networks 
      that underlie cell-state transitions in muscle diseases and ageing.

TI  - The effect of cholesterol on the long-range network of interactions established 
      among sea anemone Sticholysin II residues at the water-membrane interface.
PG  - 1647-65
LID - 10.3390/md13041647 [doi]
AB  - Actinoporins are α-pore forming proteins with therapeutic potential, produced by sea 
      anemones. Sticholysin II (StnII) from Stichodactyla helianthus is one of its most 
      extensively characterized members. These proteins remain stably folded in water, but 
      upon interaction with lipid bilayers, they oligomerize to form a pore. This event is 
      triggered by the presence of sphingomyelin (SM), but cholesterol (Chol) facilitates 
      pore formation. Membrane attachment and pore formation require changes involving 
      long-distance rearrangements of residues located at the protein-membrane interface. 
      The influence of Chol on membrane recognition, oligomerization, and/or pore 
      formation is now studied using StnII variants, which are characterized in terms of 
      their ability to interact with model membranes in the presence or absence of Chol. 
      The results obtained frame Chol not only as an important partner for SM for 
      functional membrane recognition but also as a molecule which significantly reduces 
      the structural requirements for the mentioned conformational rearrangements to 
      occur. However, given that the DOPC:SM:Chol vesicles employed display phase 
      coexistence and have domain boundaries, the observed effects could be also due to 
      the presence of these different phases on the membrane. In addition, it is also 
      shown that the Arg51 guanidinium group is strictly required for membrane 
      recognition, independently of the presence of Chol.

TI  - Jararhagin, a snake venom metalloproteinase, induces a specialized form of apoptosis 
      (anoikis) selective to endothelial cells.
PG  - 851-61
AB  - Jararhagin is a snake venom metalloproteinase (SVMP) from Bothrops jararaca involved 
      in several hemostatic and inflammatory disorders that occur in human envenomings. In 
      this study, we evaluated the effect of jararhagin on endothelial cells (tEnd). The 
      exposure of tEnd to jararhagin (20 and 40microg/ml) resulted in apoptosis with 
      activation of pro-caspase-3 and alterations in the ratio between Bax/Bcl-xL. We 
      observed that apoptosis was followed by decrease of cell viability and the loss of 
      cell adhesion. Jararhagin induced changes in cell shape with a decrease in cell 
      spreading, rounding up and detachment. This was accompanied by a rearrangement of 
      actin network and a decrease in FAK association to actin and in tyrosine 
      phosphorylated proteins. Morphological alterations and apoptosis were abolished when 
      jararhagin catalytic activity was inhibited, indicating the importance of catalysis. 
      Treatment of murine peritoneal adherent cells or fibroblasts with jararhagin did not 
      result in apoptosis. The data indicate that the pro-apoptotic effect of jararhagin 
      is selective to endothelial cells, interfering with the adhesion mechanisms and 
      inducing anoikis. The present model might be useful for the study of the 
      relationships between the architectural changes in the cytoskeleton and the complex 
      phenomenon named anoikis.

TI  - Understanding and reducing complex systems pharmacology models based on a novel 
      input-response index.
PG  - 139-157

AB  - A growing understanding of complex processes in biology has led to large-scale 
      mechanistic models of pharmacologically relevant processes. These models are 
      increasingly used to study the response of the system to a given input or stimulus, 
      e.g., after drug administration. Understanding the input-response relationship, 
      however, is often a challenging task due to the complexity of the interactions 
      between its constituents as well as the size of the models. An approach that 
      quantifies the importance of the different constituents for a given input-output 
      relationship and allows to reduce the dynamics to its essential features is 
      therefore highly desirable. In this article, we present a novel state- and 
      time-dependent quantity called the input-response index that quantifies the 
      importance of state variables for a given input-response relationship at a 
      particular time. It is based on the concept of time-bounded controllability and 
      observability, and defined with respect to a reference dynamics. In application to 
      the brown snake venom-fibrinogen (Fg) network, the input-response indices give 
      insight into the coordinated action of specific coagulation factors and about those 
      factors that contribute only little to the response. We demonstrate how the indices 
      can be used to reduce large-scale models in a two-step procedure: (i) elimination of 
      states whose dynamics have only minor impact on the input-response relationship, and 
      (ii) proper lumping of the remaining (lower order) model. In application to the 
      brown snake venom-fibrinogen network, this resulted in a reduction from 62 to 8 
      state variables in the first step, and a further reduction to 5 state variables in 
      the second step. We further illustrate that the sequence, in which a recursive 
      algorithm eliminates and/or lumps state variables, has an impact on the final 
      reduced model. The input-response indices are particularly suited to determine an 
      informed sequence, since they are based on the dynamics of the original system. In 
      summary, the novel measure of importance provides a powerful tool for analysing the 
      complex dynamics of large-scale systems and a means for very efficient model order 
      reduction of nonlinear systems.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the effect of exenatide (EXE), a glucagon-like 
      peptide (GLP)-1 receptor agonist, on kidney function, obesity indices, and glucose 
      control in overweight/obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A total 
      of 159 overweight/obese patients with T2DM were randomized to the EXE group or 
      insulin glargine (GLAR) control group for a total treatment period of 24 weeks. EXE 
      intervention significantly reduced the urine albumin concentration (UAC) at week 12 
      and 24 endpoints (P < 0.001 at week 12 and 24). The levels of the anthropometric, 
      glucose and lipid parameters (TG and HDL-c), and inflammation biomarkers (CRP and 
      TNF-α) in the EXE group were improved at 12 weeks or 24 weeks, respectively. 
      Meanwhile, a comparison between two groups showed significant changes in 
      anthropometric parameters, glucose parameters, lipid parameters (TG and HDL-c), and 
      Inflammation biomarkers (CRP, IL-6, and TNF-α). Serum fibroblast growth factor 21 
      (FGF21) was increased in the EXE group (P = 0.005) at week 24, and the change was 
      significantly improved compared with GLAR group (P = 0.003). Correlation network 
      analysis showed that FGF21 had a more central role in improving metabolism in the 
      EXE group, and the change of FGF 21 was significantly negatively correlated with UAC 
      at week 12 and week 24, respectively (r = - 0.297, P = 0.010; r = - 0.294, 
      P = 0.012). Our results showed that EXE could help patients improve UAC, glycemic 
      levels, and inflammatory biomarkers after a follow-up period of 24 weeks 
      intervention. These EXE effects may be partly mediated by FGF 21, indicating that 
      EXE is an effective and safe way to control albuminuria in overweight/obese patients 
      with T2DM.

AB  - Snake venoms contain toxins that activate the coagulation network and cause 
      venom-induced consumption coagulopathy. A previously developed mathematical model of 
      the coagulation network was refined and used to describe and predict the time course 
      of changes in the coagulation factors following envenomation by Brown snake 
      (Pseudonaja spp.), Tiger snake (Notechis scutatus), Rough-scaled snake (Tropidechis 
      carinatus) and Hoplocephalus spp. (Stephens banded, Pale headed and Broad headed). 
      Simulations of the time course of the change in coagulation factors were compared to 
      data obtained from a large prospective study of Australian snake bites - the 
      Australian Snakebite Project. The model predictions were also compared against data 
      for partial and complete VICC obtained from the same study. The model simulations 
      were used to understand the differences in consumption and recovery of clotting 
      factors in partial versus complete VICC as well as among bites from different snake 
      types. The model suggested that the venoms were absorbed almost instantaneously and 
      provided a reasonable prediction of the observed concentration of clotting factors 
      over time in patients bitten by Australian elapid snakes. The model predictions 
      suggested a higher consumption of factors (fibrinogen, II and IX in particular) in 
      patients with complete VICC compared to those with partial VICC. The model also 
      predicted that snakes with "Xa-like" venoms may produce a less severe VICC than 
      snakes with "Xa:Va-like" venoms.

PG  - 2896-901
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tropical insects and arachnids are becoming popular pets in Norway. Most 
      animals kept are harmless, but some species might cause the need for assistance from 
      the health service. This paper presents tropical arthropods common in captivity and 
      some challenges they might pose to health services. MATERIALS AND METHOD: This 
      article is mainly based on articles collected with the help of Biological Abstracts, 
      Science Citation Index and PubMed. Also, some of the findings are based on the 
      author's experience gained through keeping tropical arthropods for 15 years and 
      participating in international networks. RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: There is no 
      evidence in the literature that the bite of tarantulas is dangerous. However, the 
      large amounts of urticating hairs in many species can cause skin irritations and 
      serious eye inflammations that can be difficult to treat. The scorpion species 
      imported into the Norwegian pet trade today have no medical significance, but the 
      increasing private import of potential dangerous species via the Internet might 
      change this situation. Walking sticks and mantis are harmless insects that have no 
      medical significance. Most giant millipedes are also harmless, but some species have 
      defence fluids that can cause pathological reactions if exposed to skin, 
      mouth/throat or eyes.

TI  - Anaphylaxis to Vespa velutina nigrithorax: Pattern of Sensitization for an Emerging 
      Problem in Western Countries.
PG  - 228-235
LID - 10.18176/jiaci.0474 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define the sensitization pattern of patients with anaphylaxis to Vespa 
      velutina nigrithorax (VVN). METHODS: We studied 100 consecutive Spanish patients 
      with anaphylaxis to Hymenoptera venom and systematically determined specific IgE 
      (sIgE) to whole venoms (Vespula species, Polistes dominula, Apis mellifera, Vespa 
      crabro, and Dolichovespula maculata) and their molecular components (rApi m 1, rApi 
      m 5, rApi m 10, rVes v 1, rVes v 5, rPol d 5, and cross-reactive carbohydrates). 
      Specific IgE to VVN venom and its antigen 5 (nVesp v 5) were measured in a 
      subsample. RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients had anaphylaxis to VVN. Of these, only 16 
      (20.8%) reported previous VVN stings, but were stung by other Hymenoptera. Positive 
      sIgE (>0.35 kUA/L) to each of the whole venoms was detected in >70% of patients 
      (Vespula species in 100%). The components showing >50% positivity were rApi m 5 
      (51.4%), rPol d 5 (80.0%), and rVes v 5 (98.7%). This pattern was similar to that of 
      Vespula species anaphylaxis (n=11) but different from that of A mellifera 
      anaphylaxis (n=10). Specific IgE to nVesp v 5 was positive in all patients (n=15) 
      with VVN anaphylaxis and was correlated with sIgE to both rVes v 5 (R=0.931) and 
      rPol d 5 (R=0.887). CONCLUSIONS: VVN has become the commonest cause of Hymenoptera 
      anaphylaxis in our area. Most cases report no previous VVN stings. Their 
      sensitization pattern is similar to that of patients with anaphylaxis to other 
      Vespidae. Specific IgE to antigen-5 from VVN, Vespula species, and P dominula are 
      strongly correlated in patients with VVN anaphylaxis.

TI  - The dynamics of local tissue damage induced by Bothrops asper snake venom and 
      myotoxin II on the mouse cremaster muscle: an intravital and electron microscopic 
      study.
PG  - 41-55
AB  - The acute tissue damaging effects of Bothrops asper snake venom and a myotoxic 
      Lys-49 phospholipase A2 (myotoxin II) on the mouse cremaster muscle were studied by 
      intravital and electron microscopy. Both venom and myotoxin induced local 
      contractions of the muscle fibres within 10-60 sec after exposure, which disappeared 
      after 1-2 min. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that Bothrops 
      myotoxins act initially at the sarcolemma by affecting its permeability and allowing 
      an influx of calcium. The venom also induced an early but transient vasoconstriction 
      of arterioles. The development of edema was monitored using i.v. FITC-dextran as a 
      marker. Plasma leakage started after about 2 min of exposure to venom or myotoxin, 
      was extensive by 4-5 min, and originated from small venules and their adjoining 
      capillary segments. The venom induced formation of thrombi and emboli in venules, 
      but not in arterioles. Haemorrhage appeared after 4-6 min of exposure, the bleedings 
      always originating from capillaries and small venules. The microbleedings were 
      explosive, appearing as rapid bursts of erythrocytes into the extravascular space, 
      and suggesting a per rhexis type of haemorrhage. This was confirmed by electron 
      microscopy evaluation of the same microvessels observed intravitally, which showed 
      erythrocyte extravasation through gaps in damaged endothelial cells. Other phenomena 
      in the microcirculation included blood-flow disturbances, crenation and sphering of 
      erythrocytes, and stasis with dense packing of cells in capillary networks. Muscle 
      necrosis, caused by either venom or myotoxin, started 3-4 min after application. The 
      first sign of damage in the fibres was the development of a narrow, transverse band 
      with local loss of striation. This was followed by slow retraction of myofibrils 
      until there was a complete transverse rupture of the fibre. This process was often 
      repeated along the same fibre, leaving a row of fragments separated by spaces 
      apparently devoid of myofibrillar material. The results confirm the rapid tissue 
      damaging effects of B. asper venom, implying that potentially useful blocking agents 
      must be administered early and have the ability to diffuse rapidly into the tissues.

TI  - Peptidergic neuromodulation of the lumbar locomotor network in the neonatal rat 
      spinal cord.
PG  - 277-86
AB  - It is now well established that a dynamic balance of neurotransmitters and 
      neuromodulators finely influence the output of neuronal networks and subsequent 
      behaviors. In the present study, to further understand the modulatory processes that 
      control locomotor behavior, we investigated the action of 11 neuropeptides, chosen 
      among the various peptide subfamilies, on the lumbar neuronal network in the in 
      vitro neonatal rat spinal cord preparation. Peptides were bath-applied alone, in 
      combination with N-methyl-D,L-aspartate (NMA) or with the classical 'locomotor 
      cocktail' of NMA and serotonin. Using these different experimental paradigms, we 
      show that each peptide can neuromodulate the lumbar locomotor network and that 
      peptides exhibit different neuromodulatory profiles and potencies even within the 
      same family. Only vasopressin, oxytocin, bombesin and thyrotropin releasing hormone 
      triggered tonic or non-organized rhythmic activities when bath-applied alone. All 
      the neuropeptides modulated NMA induced activity and/ or ongoing sequences of 
      fictive locomotion to varying degrees. These results suggest that neuropeptides play 
      an important role in the control of the neural network for locomotion in the 
      neonatal rat. Their various profiles of action may account in part for the great 
      flexibility of motor behaviors.

TI  - PhTX-II a basic myotoxic phospholipase A₂ from Porthidium hyoprora snake venom, 
      pharmacological characterization and amino acid sequence by mass spectrometry.
PG  - 3077-97
LID - 10.3390/toxins6113077 [doi]
AB  - A monomeric basic PLA₂ (PhTX-II) of 14149.08 Da molecular weight was purified to 
      homogeneity from Porthidium hyoprora venom. Amino acid sequence by in tandem mass 
      spectrometry revealed that PhTX-II belongs to Asp49 PLA₂ enzyme class and displays 
      conserved domains as the catalytic network, Ca²⁺-binding loop and the hydrophobic 
      channel of access to the catalytic site, reflected in the high catalytic activity 
      displayed by the enzyme. Moreover, PhTX-II PLA₂ showed an allosteric behavior and 
      its enzymatic activity was dependent on Ca²⁺. Examination of PhTX-II PLA₂ by CD 
      spectroscopy indicated a high content of alpha-helical structures, similar to the 
      known structure of secreted phospholipase IIA group suggesting a similar folding. 
      PhTX-II PLA₂ causes neuromuscular blockade in avian neuromuscular preparations with 
      a significant direct action on skeletal muscle function, as well as, induced local 
      edema and myotoxicity, in mice. The treatment of PhTX-II by BPB resulted in complete 
      loss of their catalytic activity that was accompanied by loss of their edematogenic 
      effect. On the other hand, enzymatic activity of PhTX-II contributes to this 
      neuromuscular blockade and local myotoxicity is dependent not only on enzymatic 
      activity. These results show that PhTX-II is a myotoxic Asp49 PLA₂ that contributes 
      with toxic actions caused by P. hyoprora venom.

AB  - Scorpion and spider envenomation is treated with the appropriate antivenoms, 
      prepared as described by Césaire Auguste Phisalix and Albert Calmette in 1894. Such 
      treatment requires the acquisition and manipulation of arachnid venoms, both very 
      complicated procedures. Most of the toxins in the venoms of spiders and scorpions 
      are extremely stable cysteine-rich peptide neurotoxins. Many strategies have been 
      developed to obtain synthetic immunogens to facilitate the production of antivenoms 
      against these toxins. For example, whole peptide toxins can be synthesized by 
      solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). Also, epitopes of the toxins can be identified 
      and after the chemical synthesis of these peptide epitopes by SPPS, they can be 
      coupled to protein carriers to develop efficient immunogens. Moreover, multiple 
      antigenic peptides with a polylysine core can be designed and synthesized. This 
      review focuses on the strategies developed to obtain synthetic immunogens for the 
      production of antivenoms against the toxic Cys-rich peptides of scorpions and 
      spiders.

      mechanism of nucleotide hydrolysis. This system resembles membrane

PG  - 1-30
AB  - Human non-pancreatic PLA2 has been the object of intense scrutiny for a relatively 
      short period of time. Its role in physiology remains enigmatic. While PLA2 may serve 
      to remodel or remove peroxidised or senescent phospholipids, the enormous magnitude 
      of its upregulation during infectious or inflammatory episodes is consistent with a 
      role in host defense. However, the nature of this role remains elusive. Attempts to 
      relegate this enzyme to the genre of acute phase reactants have not been helpful in 
      unravelling its role. Difficulty in obtaining adequate amounts of native snp-PLA2 
      prior to the availability of recombinant snp-PLA2 led to the widespread use of snake 
      venom homologs, particularly in studies of the biology of PLA2. This review has 
      underscored the pitfalls inherent in that approach given the major differences 
      between some venom PLA2s as compared to snp-PLA2. In addition, it bears reiterating 
      that the complex composition of venom allows for potentiation of PLA2 activity by 
      other constituents present in venom. Whether human host defense networks employ this 
      interactive strategy is largely unknown. Nonetheless, in spite of these 
      reservations, some very compelling data have emerged in recent years implicating 
      snp-PLA2 in the initiation or potentiation of local and systemic inflammatory 
      processes. These include sepsis and associated acute lung injury as well as 
      inflammatory arthritides, with rheumatoid arthritis as the prototype. The mechanisms 
      of snp-PLA2 homeostasis are considerably better understood, and it has become 
      apparent that snp-PLA2 is an integral part of a larger network of proinflammatory 
      cytokines, growth factors and lipid mediators. The interrelationship between the 
      functions of secretory and cytosolic PLA2s remains to be defined. A number of 
      selective PLA2 inhibitors have been identified which will allow for discrimination 
      between the actions of these classes of PLA2. The availability of synthetic 
      inhibitors in conjunction with endogenous modulators of PLA2s will shift the biology 
      of PLA2 from the realm of the inferential to that of the mechanistic.

TI  - Three-Finger Toxin Diversification in the Venoms of Cat-Eye Snakes (Colubridae: 
      Boiga).
PG  - 531-545
LID - 10.1007/s00239-018-9864-6 [doi]
AB  - The Asian genus Boiga (Colubridae) is among the better studied non-front-fanged 
      snake lineages, because their bites have minor, but noticeable, effects on humans. 
      Furthermore, B. irregularis has gained worldwide notoriety for successfully invading 
      Guam and other nearby islands with drastic impacts on the local bird populations. 
      One of the factors thought to allow B. irregularis to become such a noxious pest is 
      irditoxin, a dimeric neurotoxin composed of two three-finger toxins (3FTx) joined by 
      a covalent bond between two newly evolved cysteines. Irditoxin is highly toxic to 
      diapsid (birds and reptiles) prey, but roughly 1000 × less potent to synapsids 
      (mammals). Venom plays an important role in the ecology of all species of Boiga, but 
      it remains unknown if any species besides B. irregularis produce irditoxin-like 
      dimeric toxins. In this study, we use transcriptomic analyses of venom glands from 
      five species [B. cynodon, B. dendrophila dendrophila, B. d. gemmicincta, B. 
      irregularis (Brisbane population), B. irregularis (Sulawesi population), B. 
      nigriceps, B. trigonata] and proteomic analyses of B. d. dendrophila and a 
      representative of the sister genus Toxicodryas blandingii to investigate the 
      evolutionary history of 3FTx within Boiga and its close relative. We found that 
      92.5% of Boiga 3FTx belong to a single clade which we refer to as denmotoxin-like 
      because of the close relation between these toxins and the monomeric denmotoxin 
      according to phylogenetic, sequence clustering, and protein similarity network 
      analyses. We show for the first time that species beyond B. irregularis secrete 3FTx 
      with additional cysteines in the same position as both the A and B subunits of 
      irditoxin. Transcripts with the characteristic mutations are found in B. d. 
      dendrophila, B. d. gemmicincta, B. irregularis (Brisbane population), B. irregularis 
      (Sulawesi population), and B. nigriceps. These results are confirmed by proteomic 
      analyses that show direct evidence of dimerization within the venom of B. d. 
      dendrophila, but not T. blandingii. Our results also suggest the possibility of 
      novel dimeric toxins in other genera such as Telescopus and Trimorphodon. All 
      together, this suggests that the origin of these peculiar 3FTx is far earlier than 
      was appreciated and their evolutionary history has been complex.

TI  - Microglial Activation of GLP-1R Signaling in Neuropathic Pain Promotes Gene 
      Expression Adaption Involved in Inflammatory Responses.
PG  - 9923537

LID - 9923537
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuropathic pain is a common chronic pain, which is related to 
      hypersensitivity to stimulus and greatly affects the quality of life of patients. 
      Maladaptive gene changes and molecular signaling underlie the sensitization of 
      nociceptive pathways. We previously found that the activation of microglial 
      glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) could potently relieve formalin-, bone 
      cancer-, peripheral nerve injury-, and diabetes-induced pain hypersensitivity. So 
      far, little is known about how the gene profile changes upon the activation of 
      GLP-1R signaling in the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain. METHODS: Spinal nerve 
      ligation (SNL) was performed to induce neuropathic pain in rats. Mechanical 
      allodynia was assessed using von Frey filaments. The expression of IL-10, 
      β-endorphin, and μ-opioid receptor (MOR) was examined by real-time quantitative 
      polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and whole-cell recording. Measurements of cellular 
      excitability of the substantia gelatinosa (SG) neurons by whole-cell recording were 
      carried out. R packages of differential gene expression analysis based on the 
      negative binomial distribution (DESeq2) and weighted correlation network analysis 
      (WGCNA) were used to analyze differential gene expression and the correlated modules 
      among GLP-1R clusters in neuropathic pain. RESULTS: The GLP-1R agonist, exenatide, 
      has an antiallodynic effect on neuropathic pain, which could be reversed by 
      intrathecal injections of the microglial inhibitor minocycline. Furthermore, 
      differential gene expression analysis (WGCNA) indicated that intrathecal injections 
      of exenatide could reverse the abnormal expression of 591 genes in the spinal dorsal 
      horn induced by nerve injury. WGCNA revealed 58 modules with a close relationship 
      between the microglial GLP-1R pathway and features of nerve injuries, including 
      pain, ligation, paw withdrawal latency (PWL), and anxiety. The brown module was 
      identified as the highest correlated module, and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
      Genomes (KEGG) analysis indicated that inflammatory responses were most correlated 
      with PWL. To further unravel the changes of hyperalgesia-related neuronal 
      electrophysiological activity mediated by microglia GLP-1 receptors, whole-cell 
      recording identified that MOR agonism stimulated a robust outward current in the 
      sham groups compared with the spinal nerve ligation (SNL) groups. This inhibitory 
      effect on the SNL group was more sensitive than that of the sham group after bath 
      application of β-endorphin. CONCLUSIONS: Our results further confirmed that the 
      GLP-1R pathway is involved in alleviating pain hypersensitivity mediated by spinal 
      microglia activation, and inflammatory responses were the most correlated pathway 
      associated with PWL changes in response to exenatide treatment. We found that the 
      identification of gene regulation in response to GLP-1R activation is an effective 
      strategy for identifying new therapeutic targets for neuropathic pain. Investigation 
      for the activation of spinal microglial GLP-1R which might ameliorate inflammatory 
      responses through gene expression and structural changes is providing a potential 
      biomarker in pain management.

TI  - Amphiphilic beta-sheet cobra cardiotoxin targets mitochondria and disrupts its 
      network.
PG  - 3169-74
AB  - Recent advance in understanding the role of toxin proteins in controlling cell death 
      has revealed that pro-apoptotic viral proteins targeting mitochondria contain 
      amphiphilic alpha-helices with pore-forming properties. Herein, we describe that the 
      pore-forming amphiphilic beta-sheet cardiotoxins (or cytotoxins, CTXs) from Taiwan 
      cobra (Naja atra) also target mitochondrial membrane after internalization and act 
      synergistically with CTX-induced cytosolic calcium increase to disrupt mitochondria 
      network. It is suggested that CTX-induced fragmentation of mitochondria play a role 
      in controlling CTX-induced necrosis of myocytes and cause severe tissue necrosis in 
      the victims.

TI  - CoaTx-II, a new dimeric Lys49 phospholipase A2 from Crotalus oreganus abyssus snake 
      venom with bactericidal potential: Insights into its structure and biological roles.

AB  - Snake venoms are rich and intriguing sources of biologically-active molecules that 
      act on target cells, modulating a diversity of physiological functions and 
      presenting promising pharmacological applications. Lys49 phospholipase A2 is one of 
      the multifunctional proteins present in these complex secretions and, although 
      catalytically inactive, has a variety of biological activities, including cytotoxic, 
      antibacterial, inflammatory, antifungal activities. Herein, a Lys49 phospholipase 
      A2, denominated CoaTx-II from Crotalus oreganus abyssus, was purified and 
      structurally and pharmacologically characterized. CoaTx-II was isolated with a high 
      degree of purity by a combination of two chromatographic steps; molecular exclusion 
      and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. This toxin is dimeric 
      with a mass of 13868.2 Da (monomeric form), as determined by mass spectrometry. 
      CoaTx-II is rich in Arg and Lys residues and displays high identity with other Lys49 
      PLA2 homologues, which have high isoelectric points. The structural model of dimeric 
      CoaTx-II shows that the toxin is non-covalently stabilized. Despite its enzymatic 
      inactivity, in vivo CoaTx-II caused local muscular damage, characterized by 
      increased plasma creatine kinase and confirmed by histological alterations, in 
      addition to an inflammatory activity, as demonstrated by mice paw edema induction 
      and pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 elevation. CoaTx-II also presents antibacterial 
      activity against gram negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa 31NM, Escherichia coli ATCC 
      25922) and positive (Staphyloccocus aureus BEC9393 and Rib1) bacteria. Therefore, 
      data show that this newly purified toxin plays a central role in mediating the 
      degenerative events associated with envenomation, in addition to demonstrating 
      antibacterial properties, with potential for use in the development of strategies 
      for antivenom therapy and combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

AB  - Loxoscelism is caused by envenomation by spiders from Loxosceles genus. Clinical 
      symptoms only appear a few hours after envenomation and can evolve in local 
      reactions, such as dermonecrosis, and systemic reactions, including intravascular 
      haemolysis, intravascular coagulation and renal failure. Considering that 
      alterations in the microcirculatory network are involved in the pathogenesis of 
      different diseases, including the inflammatory process, the aim of this study was to 
      investigate the action of venoms of males and females of Loxosceles intermedia and 
      Loxosceles laeta on the microcirculatory network and examine the systemic production 
      of inflammatory mediators in a murine model of loxoscelism. We observed that during 
      systemic envenomation, the alterations in the microcirculation include increase in 
      the number of rolling cells, which was more intense in animals injected with female 
      Loxosceles spider venoms. This positively correlated with increase in TNF-α and NO 
      serum levels, induction of which was higher by female venoms when compared with male 
      venoms. The increase of leukocytes rolling was not accompanied by increase of cell 
      adhesion. The absence of leukocyte extravasation may explain why in mice, in 
      contrast to humans, no cutaneous loxoscelism occurs. Thus, targeting the neutrophil 
      adhesion and extravasation in Loxosceles envenomed patients may prevent cutaneous 
      pathology.

      (Pseudechis australis) venom.

LID - 10.1097/PAT.0000000000000120 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to determine the relative sensitivity of activated partial 
      thromboplastin time (aPTT) reagents to the anticoagulant effects of phospholipases 
      in mulga snake (Pseudechis australis) venom.Twenty-one haematology laboratories 
      participating in the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia Quality Assurance 
      Programs were sent human plasma samples spiked with mulga venom (n=25 total 
      results). Results for 17 patients with mulga snake envenoming were available through 
      the Australian Snakebite Project.Only 12 of 25 venom spiked samples returned an 
      abnormally prolonged aPTT. Tests performed with Dade Actin FS (n=7) did not identify 
      any of the spiked samples as abnormal. Although clotting times were significantly 
      prolonged using the lupus anticoagulant sensitive Actin FSL (n=5, p=0.043), only one 
      was reported as abnormal. Only laboratories using TriniCLOT aPTT S (n=6), HemosIL 
      APTT SP (n=2) and Stago PTT-A (n=1) consistently recorded the spiked sample as being 
      above the upper normal reference interval. Abnormally prolonged aPTTs were recorded 
      for four of eight patients whose tests were performed with Actin FSL, five of eight 
      patients with TriniCLOT aPTT HS, and three of three patients using TriniCLOT aPTT 
      S.We conclude that some reagents used for routine aPTT testing are relatively 
      insensitive to the anticoagulant effects of mulga snake venom. Tests performed with 
      these reagents should be interpreted with caution.

TI  - Structural, functional, and bioinformatics studies reveal a new snake venom 
      homologue phospholipase A₂ class.
PG  - 61-78
LID - 10.1002/prot.22858 [doi]
AB  - Phospholipases A₂ (PLA₂s) are enzymes responsible for membrane disruption through 
      Ca(2+) -dependent hydrolysis of phospholipids. Lys49-PLA₂s are well-characterized 
      homologue PLA₂s that do not show catalytic activity but can exert a pronounced local 
      myotoxic effect. These homologue PLA₂s were first believed to present residual 
      catalytic activity but experiments with a recombinant toxin show they are incapable 
      of catalysis. Herein, we present a new homologue Asp49-PLA₂ (BthTX-II) that is also 
      able to exert muscle damage. This toxin was isolated in 1992 and characterized as 
      presenting very low catalytic activity. Interestingly, this myotoxic homologue 
      Asp49-PLA₂ conserves all the residues responsible for Ca(2+) coordination and of the 
      catalytic network, features thought to be fundamental for PLA₂ enzymatic activity. 
      Previous crystallographic studies of apo BthTX-II suggested this toxin could be 
      catalytically inactive since a distortion in the calcium binding loop was observed. 
      In this article, we show BthTX-II is not catalytic based on an in vitro cell 
      viability assay and time-lapse experiments on C2C12 myotube cell cultures, X-ray 
      crystallography and phylogenetic studies. Cell culture experiments show that 
      BthTX-II is devoid of catalytic activity, as already observed for Lys49-PLA₂s. 
      Crystallographic studies of the complex BthTX-II/Ca(2+) show that the distortion of 
      the calcium binding loop is still present and impairs ion coordination even though 
      Ca(2+) are found interacting with other regions of the protein. Phylogenetic studies 
      demonstrate that BthTX-II is more phylogenetically related to Lys49-PLA₂s than to 
      other Asp49-PLA₂s, thus allowing Crotalinae subfamily PLA₂s to be classified into 
      two main branches: a catalytic and a myotoxic one.

TI  - Characterization of in vitro metabolites of toad venom using high-performance liquid 
      chromatography and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.
PG  - 1321-7
AB  - The characterization of the in vitro metabolites of toad venom, which has been 
      widely used as a traditional Chinese drug, Ch'an Su, has been completed. Toad venom 
      contains bufotoxins (such as marinobufotoxin; marinobufagin 3-suberoylarginine 
      ester) and bufogenins (such as marinobufagin and bufalin) as the main cardiac 
      steroids. An in vitro experiment using the rat or human liver cytosolic fraction 
      disclosed that marinobufotoxin produced marinobufagin, but not its 3-hemisuberate. 
      Marinobufagin was subjected to the enzyme reaction using the rat or human liver 
      microsomal fraction together with NADPH and NAD, which produced 
      3-dehydromarinobufagin and 3-epimarinobufagin. Marinobufagin produced its 3-sulfate 
      upon treatment with the rat or human liver cytosolic fraction and 
      3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate. Bufalin was also subjected to the above 
      enzyme reactions and showed almost the same results except for the result that the 
      hydroxylation occurred at the 5beta-position. On the other hand, small amounts of 
      marinobufagin 3-glucuronide were obtained only by treatment with the human liver 
      microsomal fraction and uridine 5'-diphosphoglucuronic acid. The structures of these 
      metabolites were confirmed using authentic samples regarding their high-performance 
      liquid chromatographic behavior and/or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry 
      analysis.

LID - 23
AB  - Global warming and eutrophication contribute to formation of HABs and distribution 
      of alien cyanobacteria northward. The current study assessed how alien to Europe 
      Sphaerospermopsis aphanizomenoides and Chrysosporum bergii will co-occur with 
      dominant native Planktothrix agardhii and Aphanizomenon gracile species under 
      changing conditions in temperate freshwaters. The experiments were carried out to 
      examine the effect of nutrients and temperature on the growth rate of cyanobacteria, 
      production of cyanotoxins, and interspecies competition. The highest growth rate was 
      determined for A. gracile (0.43 day(-1)) and S. aphanizomenoides (0.40 day(-1)) 
      strains at all the tested nutrient concentrations (IP and IN were significant 
      factors). S. aphanizomenoides adapted to the wide range of nutrient concentrations 
      and temperature due to high species ecological plasticity; however, A. gracile was 
      able to suppress its dominance under changing conditions. Regularity between tested 
      variables and STX concentration in A. gracile was not found, but IP concentration 
      negatively correlated with the amount of dmMC-RR and other non-ribosomal peptides 
      (NRPs) in P. agardhii strains. The relative concentration of NRPs in nontoxic P. 
      agardhii strain was up to 3-fold higher than in MC-producing strain. Our study 
      indicated that nutrients, temperature, and species had significant effects on 
      interspecies competition. A. gracile had a negative effect on biomass of both alien 
      species and P. agardhii.

TI  - Irukandji-like syndrome caused by single-tentacle box jellyfish found in Thailand, 
      2007-2019.
PG  - 91-96
LID - 10.5603/IMH.2020.0017 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irukandji syndrome definition is still widely misunderstood. 
      Irukandji-like syndrome is more unclear than Irukandji syndrome. This study aimed to 
      describe Irukandji-like syndrome in cases involving stinging by single-tentacle box 
      jellyfish species in Thailand. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Surveillance system and 
      networks of toxic jellyfish incidents were established to enable case detection. In 
      the period 2007 to 2019, all cases of stinging by single-tentacle box jellyfish 
      resulting in collapse, hospital attendance or death were investigated. RESULTS: The 
      majority of the 19 Irukandji-like syndrome cases were male (68.2%), median age 35.0 
      years (range 6.0-60.0), and Thai nationality (52.3%). Clinical manifestations of 
      Irukandji-like syndrome were categorised as severe wound pain with immediate 
      systemic reaction (66.7%), moderate wound pain with gradual systemic reaction 
      (16.7%), and moderate wound pain with the immediate systemic reaction after a 
      physical/chemical trigger (16.7%). The pain occurring when being stung differed from 
      the pain occurring during the systemic reaction. The five most common symptoms were 
      pain (100.0%), high blood pressure (100.0%), palpitations (86.7%), respiratory 
      distress (52.6%), and near collapse/collapse (31.6%). The pain occurs when being 
      stung was excruciating or burning pain at the wounds, felt like an electric shock, 
      and rapidly expanded to heart pain. While the pain occurring during the systemic 
      reaction was back pain, muscle pain, joint pain, abdominal pain, and body aches. The 
      marks from the tentacles appeared similar in appearance to the caterpillar tracks of 
      tanks. In 6 cases the species could be identified and all of them involving the 
      Morbakka spp. CONCLUSIONS: This was the largest study of Irukandji-like syndrome 
      cases involving stings by single-tentacle box jellyfish in Thailand and the 
      different clinical manifestations might be caused by different species of 
      single-tentacle box jellyfish.

TI  - Biochemical and functional studies of ColTx-I, a new myotoxic phospholipase A2 
      isolated from Crotalus oreganus lutosus (Great Basin rattlesnake) snake venom.

AB  - Commonly, phospholipases A2 (PLA2s) play key roles in the pathogenesis of the local 
      tissue damage characteristic of crotaline and viperine snake envenomations. Crotalus 
      oreganus lutosus snake venom has not been extensively studied; therefore, the 
      characterization of its components represents a valuable biotechnological tool for 
      studying pathophysiological processes of envenoming and for gaining a deeper 
      understanding of its biological effects. In this study, for the first time, a basic 
      PLA2 myotoxin, ColTx-I, was purified from C. o. lutosus through two chromatographic 
      steps. ColTx-I is monomeric with calculated molecular mass weight (Mw) of 14,145 Da 
      and a primary structure closely related to basic PLA2s from viperid venoms. The pure 
      enzyme has a specific activity of 15.87 ± 0.65 nmol/min/mg at optimal conditions (pH 
      8.0 and 37 °C). ColTx-I activity was found to be dependent on Ca(2+), as its 
      substitution by other ionic species as well as the addition of chelating agents 
      significantly reduced its phospholipase activity. In vivo, ColTx-I triggered 
      dose-dependent inflammatory responses, measured using the paw edema model, with an 
      increase in IL-6 levels, systemic and local myotoxicity, characterized by elevated 
      plasma creatine kinase activity. ColTx-I induced a complex series of degenerative 
      events associated with edema, inflammatory infiltrate and skeletal muscle necrosis. 
      These biochemical and functional results suggest that ColTx-I, a myotoxic and 
      inflammatory mediator, plays a relevant role in C. o. lutosus envenomation. Thus, 
      detailed studies on its mechanism of action, such as evaluating the synergism 
      between ColTx-I and other venom components may reveal targets for the development of 
      more specific and effective therapies.

      effects, but does not efficiently reverse the local symptoms elicited by the 
      Bothrops jararaca venom (BjV). The mechanisms involved in this poor protection have 
      not been clarified. In this work, intravital microscopy studies were carried out to 
      determine the efficacy of different schedules of BAv treatment on local effects 
      evoked by topical application of BjV in the microcirculatory network of the internal 
      spermatic fascia of Wistar rats. Results demonstrated that BAv administration 15 min 
      before, simultaneously with, or 15 min after BjV application did not totally reverse 
      the local symptoms, represented by disturbances of coagulation, development of 
      haemorrhage lesions, vascular permeability increase and increment on 
      leukocyte-endothelium interactions. This lack of effectiveness neither reflects an 
      inadequate amount of specific antibodies in the antivenom against toxins responsible 
      for local effects nor an insufficient dose of circulating BAv during the assays. 
      Administration of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labelled-BAv showed the dynamics 
      of distribution of the antivenom in the microcirculatory network. Images obtained 
      from prior and simultaneously treated animals showed that the antivenom remains at 
      luminal side of vessels before venom application, and the latency time to antivenom 
      leakage is coincidental to that for local effects evoked by the venom. In addition, 
      images from posterior treatment demonstrated that the intense alterations in the 
      microcirculatory network impair antivenom distribution at the site of injection. 
      Together, our data show that the lack of effectiveness of antivenom therapy is due 
      to impaired and delayed venom and antivenom interaction at the site of injury.

AB  - The effect of brain extracellular matrix (ECM) on synaptic plasticity remains 
      controversial. Here, we show that targeted enzymatic attenuation with chondroitinase 
      ABC (ChABC) of ECM triggers the appearance of new glutamatergic synapses on 
      hippocampal pyramidal neurons, thereby increasing the amplitude of field EPSPs while 
      decreasing both the mean miniature EPSC amplitude and AMPA/NMDA ratio. Although the 
      increased proportion of 'unpotentiated' synapses caused by ECM attenuation should 
      promote long-term potentiation (LTP), surprisingly, LTP was suppressed. The 
      upregulation of small conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (SK) channels decreased the 
      excitability of pyramidal neurons, thereby suppressing LTP. A blockade of SK 
      channels restored cell excitability and enhanced LTP; this enhancement was abolished 
      by a blockade of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), which is involved in the 
      maturation of dendritic spines. Thus, targeting ECM elicits the appearance of new 
      synapses, which can have potential applications in regenerative medicine. However, 
      this process is compensated for by a reduction in postsynaptic neuron excitability, 
      preventing network overexcitation at the expense of synaptic plasticity.

TI  - Scorpion toxin inhibits the voltage-gated proton channel using a Zn(2+) -like 
      long-range conformational coupling mechanism.
PG  - 2351-2364
LID - 10.1111/bph.14984 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Blocking the voltage-gated proton channel H(V) 1 is a 
      promising strategy for the treatment of diseases like ischaemia stroke and cancer. 
      However, few H(V) 1 channel antagonists have been reported. Here, we have identified 
      a novel H(V) 1 channel antagonist from scorpion venom and have elucidated its action 
      mechanism. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: H(V) 1 and NaV channels were heterologously 
      expressed in mammalian cell lines and their currents recorded using whole-cell patch 
      clamp. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate mutants. Toxins were 
      recombinantly produced in Escherichia coli. AGAP/W38F-H(V) 1 interaction was 
      modelled by molecular dynamics simulations. KEY RESULTS: The scorpion toxin AGAP 
      (anti-tumour analgesic peptide) potently inhibited H(V) 1 currents. One AGAP mutant 
      has reduced Na(V) channel activity but intact H(V) 1 activity (AGAP/W38F). AGAP/W38F 
      inhibited H(V) 1 channel activation by trapping its S4 voltage sensor in a 
      deactivated state and inhibited H(V) 1 currents with less pH dependence than Zn(2+) 
      . Mutation analysis showed that the binding pockets of AGAP/W38F and Zn(2+) in H(V) 
      1 channel partly overlapped (common sites are His140 and His193). The E153A mutation 
      at the intracellular Coulombic network (ICN) in H(V) 1 channel markedly reduced 
      AGAP/W38F inhibition, as observed for Zn(2+) . Experimental data and MD simulations 
      suggested that AGAP/W38F inhibited H(V) 1 channel using a Zn(2+) -like long-range 
      conformational coupling mechanism. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Our results suggest 
      that the Zn(2+) binding pocket in H(V) 1 channel might be a hotspot for modulators 
      and valuable for designing H(V) 1 channel ligands. Moreover, AGAP/W38F is a useful 
      molecular probe to study H(V) 1 channel and a lead compound for drug development.

AB  - Memories are acquired and encoded within large-scale neuronal networks spanning 
      different brain areas. The anatomical and functional specificity of such long-range 
      interactions and their role in learning is poorly understood. The amygdala and the 
      medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are interconnected brain structures involved in the 
      extinction of conditioned fear. Here, we show that a defined subpopulation of basal 
      amygdala (BA) projection neurons targeting the prelimbic (PL) subdivision of mPFC is 
      active during states of high fear, whereas BA neurons targeting the infralimbic (IL) 
      subdivision are recruited, and exhibit cell-type-specific plasticity, during fear 
      extinction. Pathway-specific optogenetic manipulations demonstrate that the activity 
      balance between pathways is causally involved in fear extinction. Together, our 
      findings demonstrate that, although intermingled locally, long-range connectivity 
      defines distinct subpopulations of amygdala projection neurons and indicate that the 
      formation of long-term extinction memories depends on the balance of activity 
      between two defined amygdala-prefrontal pathways.

TI  - Early identification of acute kidney injury in Russell's viper (Daboia russelii) 
      envenoming using renal biomarkers.
PG  - e0007486

LID - e0007486
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major complication of snake envenoming, 
      but early diagnosis remains problematic. We aimed to investigate the time course of 
      novel renal biomarkers in AKI following Russell's viper (Daboia russelii) bites. 
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We recruited a cohort of patients with definite 
      Russell's viper envenoming and collected serial blood and urine samples on admission 
      (<4h post-bite), 4-8h, 8-16h, 16-24h, 1 month and 3 months post-bite. AKI stage 
      (1-3) was defined using the Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria. AKI stages (1-3) 
      were defined by the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria. There were 65 
      Russell's viper envenomings and 49 developed AKI: 24 AKIN stage 1, 13 stage 2 and 12 
      stage 3. There was a significant correlation between venom concentrations and AKI 
      stage (p = 0.007), and between AKI stage and six peak biomarker concentrations. 
      Although most biomarker concentrations were elevated within 8h, no biomarker 
      performed well in diagnosing AKI <4h post-bite. Three biomarkers were superior to 
      serum creatinine (sCr) in predicting AKI (stage 2/3) 4-8h post-bite: serum cystatin 
      C (sCysC) with an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC-ROC), 0.78 
      (95%CI:0.64-0.93), urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (uNGAL), 0.74 
      (95%CI:0.59-0.87) and urine clusterin (uClu), 0.81 (95%CI:0.69-0.93). No biomarker 
      was better than sCr after 8h. Six other urine biomarkers urine albumin, urine 
      beta2-microglobulin, urine kidney injury molecule-1, urine cystatin C, urine trefoil 
      factor-3 and urine osteopontin either had minimal elevation, and/or minimal 
      prediction for AKI stage 2/3 (AUC-ROC<0.7). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: AKI was common 
      and sometimes severe following Russell's viper bites. Three biomarkers uClu, uNGAL 
      and sCysC, appeared to become abnormal in AKI earlier than sCr, and may be useful in 
      early identification of envenoming.

TI  - A comparison of the crystal structures of phospholipase A2 from bovine pancreas and 
      Crotalus atrox venom.
PG  - 11627-34
AB  - The refined high resolution crystal structure of the bovine phospholipase A2 was 
      compared with its counterpart from the venom of Crotalus atrox, the western 
      diamondbacked rattlesnake. The strong similarity in their backbone conformations 
      forms the basis of a common numbering system for the amino acid sequence. The three 
      common major helices and much of the extended chain form a nearly identical 
      "homologous core" structure. The variations in conformation usually arise from 
      deletions/insertions or en bloc shifts of structural units. The exception to this is 
      part of the highly conserved calcium-binding loop; however, this is to be expected 
      as 1) there is no calcium ion sequestered in the venom dimer as there is in the case 
      of the bovine enzyme and 2) two side chains in that segment form dimer-stabilizing 
      interactions between the subunits of the C. atrox enzyme. The absolutely conserved 
      catalytic network of hydrogen-bonded side chains formed by His 48, Tyr 52, Tyr 73, 
      and Asp 99, as well as the hydrophobic wall that shields it, are virtually 
      superimposable in the two structures. However, the details of the structural 
      relationship between the amino terminus and the catalytic network differ in the two 
      species and the ordered water molecules thought to be either functionally or 
      structurally important in the pancreatic enzymes are not found in the crystal 
      structure of the phospholipase A2 from C. atrox. The most striking difference from a 
      functional standpoint is the fact that the surface depression in the region of the 
      catalytic network that has been commonly considered the active site is shielded 
      substantially in forming the intersubunit contact surface of the dimeric venom 
      enzyme.

PG  - 604-6

AB  - Unusual suicide attempts often remain undetected, and bizarre methods can be a clue 
      to psychotic origin. We report a suicide attempt by proxy--the bite of a puff 
      adder--and provide a brief literature survey about further archaic self-injurious 
      behaviour. Due to the easy availability of venomous snakes and the close networking 
      of suicidal patients via the Internet, an increase in similar cases can be 
      anticipated. A failed suicide attempt should always be considered in patients 
      surviving bizarre accidents.

TI  - Oral semaglutide versus injectable glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists: a cost 
      of control analysis.
PG  - 650-658
LID - 10.1080/13696998.2020.1722678 [doi]
AB  - Aims: The efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide, the first glucagon-like peptide-1 
      (GLP-1) receptor agonist developed for oral administration for the treatment of type 
      2 diabetes, was evaluated in the PIONEER clinical trial program, and a recently 
      published network meta-analysis allowed comparison with further injectable GLP-1 
      receptor agonists. The present study aimed to assess the short-term cost- 
      effectiveness of oral semaglutide 14 mg versus subcutaneous once-weekly dulaglutide 
      1.5 mg, once-weekly exenatide 2 mg, twice-daily exenatide 10 µg, once-daily 
      liraglutide 1.8 mg, once-daily lixisenatide 20 µg, and once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg, 
      in terms of the cost per patient achieving glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) targets (cost 
      of control).Materials and methods: Cost of control was calculated by dividing the 
      annual treatment costs associated with an intervention by the proportion of patients 
      achieving the treatment target with an intervention, with outcomes calculated for 
      targets of HbA1c ≤6.5% and HbA1c <7.0% for all included GLP-1 receptor agonists. 
      Annual treatment costs were accounted in 2019 United States dollars (USD), based on 
      2019 wholesale acquisition cost.Results: For the treatment target of HbA1c ≤6.5%, 
      once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg and oral semaglutide 14 mg were associated with the 
      lowest costs of control, at USD 15,430 and USD 17,383 per patient achieving target, 
      respectively. Similarly, the cost of control was lowest with once-weekly semaglutide 
      1 mg at USD 12,627 per patient achieving target, followed by oral semaglutide 14 mg 
      at USD 13,493 per patient achieving target for the target of HbA1c <7.0%. All other 
      interventions were associated with higher cost of control values for both 
      targets.Conclusions: Oral semaglutide 14 mg is likely to be cost-effective versus 
      dulaglutide, exenatide (once weekly and twice daily), liraglutide, and lixisenatide 
      in terms of bringing people with type 2 diabetes to glycemic control targets of 
      HbA1c ≤6.5% and HbA1c <7.0% in the US.

AB  - Opioid-induced respiratory depression is a major obstacle to improving the clinical 
      management of moderate to severe chronic pain. Opioids inhibit neuronal activity via 
      various pathways, including calcium channels, adenylyl cyclase, and potassium 
      channels. Currently, the underlying molecular pathway of opioid-induced respiratory 
      depression is only partially understood. This study aimed to investigate the 
      mechanisms of opioid-induced respiratory depression in vivo by examining the effects 
      of different pharmacological agents on fentanyl-induced respiratory depression. 
      Respiratory parameters were detected using whole body plethysmography in conscious 
      rats. We show that pre-treatment with the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H89 
      reversed the fentanyl-related effects on respiratory rate, inspiratory time, and 
      expiratory time. Pre-treatment with the G protein-gated inwardly rectifying 
      potassium (GIRK) channel blocker Tertiapin-Q dose-dependently reversed the 
      fentanyl-related effects on respiratory rate and inspiratory time. A 
      phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) 
      analogs did not affect fentanyl-induced respiratory depression. These findings 
      suggest that PKA and GIRK may be involved in fentanyl-induced respiratory depression 
      and could represent useful therapeutic targets for the treatment of fentanyl-induced 
      ventilatory depression.

TI  - The dinoponeratoxin peptides from the giant ant Dinoponera quadriceps display in 
      vitro antitrypanosomal activity.
PG  - 187-196
LID - 10.1515/hsz-2017-0198 [doi]
AB  - The crude venom of the giant ant Dinoponera quadriceps is a cocktail of polypeptides 
      and organic compounds that shows antiparasitic effects against Trypanosoma cruzi, 
      the causative agent of Chagas disease. In order to investigate the venom-derived 
      components responsible for such antitrypanosomal activity, four dinoponeratoxins 
      (DnTxs) were identified, namely M-PONTX-Dq3a, -Dq3b, -Dq3c and -Dq4e, that are 
      diverse in size, net charge, hydrophobicity and propensity to interact with 
      eukaryote cell membranes. These peptides were tested against epimastigote, 
      trypomastigote and amastigote forms of benznidazole (Bz)-resistant Y strain of T. 
      cruzi and in mammalian host cells. The M-PONTX-Dq3a and -Dq4e inhibited all 
      developmental forms of T. cruzi, including amastigotes, the responsible form for the 
      maintenance of infection on chronic phase of the disease. The M-PONTX-Dq3a showed 
      the highest selectivity index (SI) (80) and caused morphological alterations in T. 
      cruzi, as observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and induced cell death 
      through necrosis, as seen by multiparametric flow cytometry analysis with specific 
      biochemical markers. Altogether, the D. quadriceps venom appears as a source for the 
      prospection of trypanocidal peptides and the M-PONTX-Dq3a arises as a candidate 
      among the dinoponeratoxin-related peptides in the development of compounds against 
      Chagas disease.

TI  - Molecular cloning of two toxic phospholipases A2 from the crown-of-thorns starfish 
      Acanthaster planci venom.
PG  - 54-60
AB  - The full-length cDNAs encoding two toxic phospholipases A2 (AP-PLA2-I and -II) from 
      the crown-of-thorns starfish Acanthaster planci venom were individually cloned by 
      RT-PCR, 3'RACE and 5'RACE. In common with both AP-PLA2s, the precursor protein is 
      composed of a signal peptide, a propeptide and a mature protein (136 and 135 
      residues for AP-PLA2-I and -II, respectively). The four motifs (Ca2+-binding loop, 
      Ca2+-binding site, active site and catalytic network) characteristic of groups I and 
      II PLA2s are well conserved in both AP-PLA2s. In addition to this, the presence of 
      the elapid and pancreatic loops and the involvement of a propeptide in the 
      precursors suggested that AP-PLA2s are highly analogous to the group IB PLA2s. 
      However, when compared to the amino acid sequence of bovine pancreatic PLA2, the 
      representative group IB PLA2, AP-PLA2s require some amino acid insertions and 
      deletions in the region 76-100, as previously observed for the starfish Asterina 
      pectinifera PLA2s. Furthermore, the phylogenetic tree made clearly demonstrated that 
      AP-PLA2s and A. pectinifera PLA2s are distinguishable from the group IB PLA2s as 
      well as other PLA2s, being classified into a new group.

TI  - Predicting plant immunity gene expression by identifying the decoding mechanism of 
      calcium signatures.
PG  - 1598-1609
LID - 10.1111/nph.14924 [doi]
AB  - Calcium plays a key role in determining the specificity of a vast array of 
      signalling pathways in plants. Cellular calcium elevations with different 
      characteristics (calcium signatures) carry information on the identity of the 
      primary stimulus, ensuring appropriate downstream responses. However, the mechanism 
      for decoding calcium signatures is unknown. To determine this, decoding of the 
      salicylic acid (SA)-mediated plant immunity signalling network controlling gene 
      expression was examined. A dynamic mathematical model of the SA-mediated plant 
      immunity network was developed. This model was used to predict responses to 
      different calcium signatures; these were validated empirically using quantitative 
      real-time PCR to measure gene expression. The mechanism for decoding calcium 
      signatures to control expression of plant immunity genes enhanced disease 
      susceptibility 1 (EDS1) and isochorismate synthase 1 (ICS1) was identified. Calcium, 
      calmodulin, calmodulin-binding transcription activators (CAMTA)3 and calmodulin 
      binding protein 60g (CBP60g) together amplify each calcium signature into three 
      active signals, simultaneously regulating expression. The time required for calcium 
      to return to steady-state level also quantitatively regulates gene expression. 
      Decoding of calcium signatures occurs via nonlinear interactions between these 
      active signals, producing a unique response in each case. Key properties of the 
      calcium signatures are not intuitive, exemplifying the importance of mathematical 
      modelling approaches. This approach can be applied to identifying the decoding 
      mechanisms of other plant calcium signalling pathways.

TI  - Structural changes in the model of the outer cell membrane of Gram-negative bacteria 
      interacting with melittin: an in situ spectroelectrochemical study.
PG  - 68-85
LID - 10.1039/d0fd00039f [doi]
AB  - The cell membrane of Gram-negative bacteria interacting with an antimicrobial 
      peptide presents a complex supramolecular assembly. Fabrication of models of 
      bacterial cell membranes remains a large experimental challenge. Langmuir-Blodgett 
      and Langmuir-Schaefer (LS-LB) transfer makes possible the deposition of 
      multicomponent asymmetric lipid bilayers onto a gold surface. Two lipids: 
      1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE) and 
      di[3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonyl]-lipid A (KLA) were used to deposit a model of the 
      outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria on the Au(111) substrate. The use of gold 
      as the solid substrate enables control of the membrane potential. Molecular scale 
      changes in the model membrane exposed to physiological electric fields and 
      interacting with melittin antimicrobial peptide are discussed in this paper. The 
      interaction of the outer membrane with melittin leads to an increase in the membrane 
      capacitance and permeability to ions and water. The stability of the outer membrane 
      with bound melittin decreases at positive membrane potentials. In situ polarization 
      modulation infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy is used to investigate 
      membrane potential-dependent changes in the structure of the outer membrane 
      interacting with melittin. The hydration of the ester carbonyl groups is not 
      affected by the interaction with melittin. However, the orientation and hydrogen 
      bond network with the carboxylate groups in KLA changes drastically after POPE-KLA 
      bilayer interacts with melittin. We propose that the positively charged groups in 
      the amino acids present at the C-terminus of the peptide interact directly with the 
      polar head group of KLA. Simultaneously, the packing order in hydrocarbon chains in 
      the membrane with bound melittin increases. A hydrophobic match between the chains 
      in the lipids and the peptide, which spans the membrane, seems to be responsible for 
      the ordering of the hydrocarbon chains region of the bilayer. The N-terminus enters 
      into the hydrophobic region of the membrane and forms a channel to the hydrophilic 
      head groups in POPE.

TI  - Intrinsic local disorder and a network of charge-charge interactions are key to 
      actinoporin membrane disruption and cytotoxicity.

AB  - Actinoporins are a family of sea anemone proteins that bind to membranes and produce 
      functional pores which result in cell lysis. Actinoporin variants with decreased 
      lytic activity usually show a reduced affinity for membranes. However, for some of 
      these mutant versions there is no direct correlation between the loss of binding 
      affinity and the decrease in their overall lytic activity, suggesting that other 
      steps in pore formation may be hampered or facilitated by the mutations. To test 
      this hypothesis on the mechanism of pore formation by this interesting family of 
      proteins, structural and dynamic NMR studies have been carried out on two disabled 
      variants of the actinoporin Sticholysin II, R29Q and Y111N. It is shown that their 
      lytic activity is not only related to their membrane affinity but also to their 
      conformational mechanism for membrane insertion. Alterations in their activities can 
      be explained by structural, electrostatic and dynamic differences in a cluster of 
      aromatic moieties and the N-terminus. In addition, the dynamic properties of some 
      segments located at the C-terminus of the R29Q variant suggest a relevant role for 
      this region in terms of protein-protein interactions. On the basis of all these 
      results, we propose that R29 anchors a network of electrostatic interactions crucial 
      for the actinoporin's approach to the membrane and that Y111 induces a necessary 
      disorder in the loop regions that bind to membranes.

TI  - Serotonin modulates dendritic calcium influx in commissural interneurons in the 
      mouse spinal locomotor network.
PG  - 2157-67
AB  - Commissural interneurons (CINs) help to coordinate left-right alternating bursting 
      activity during fictive locomotion in the neonatal mouse spinal cord. Serotonin 
      (5-HT) plays an active role in the induction of fictive locomotion in the isolated 
      spinal cord, but the cellular targets and mechanisms of its actions are relatively 
      unknown. We investigated the possible role of serotonin in modifying dendritic 
      calcium currents, using a combination of two-photon microscopy and patch-clamp 
      recordings, in identified CINs in the upper lumbar region. Dendritic calcium 
      responses to applied somatic voltage-clamp steps were measured using fluorescent 
      calcium indicator imaging. Serotonin evoked significant reductions in 
      voltage-dependent dendritic calcium influx in about 40% of the dendritic sites 
      studied, with no detectable effect in the remaining sites. We also detected 
      differential effects of serotonin in different dendritic sites of the same neuron; 
      serotonin could decrease voltage-sensitive calcium influx at one site, with no 
      effect at a nearby site. Voltage-clamp studies confirmed that serotonin reduces the 
      voltage-dependent calcium current in CINs. Current-clamp experiments showed that the 
      serotonin-evoked decreases in dendritic calcium influx were coupled with increases 
      in neuronal excitability; we discuss possible mechanisms by which these two 
      seemingly opposing results can be reconciled. This research demonstrates that 
      dendritic calcium currents are targets of serotonin modulation in a group of spinal 
      interneurons that are components of the mouse locomotor network.

TI  - Three-dimensional solution structure of Tropidechis carinatus venom extract 
      trocarin: a structural homologue of Xa and prothrombin activator.
PG  - 302-13
AB  - Trocarin belongs to group D of prothrombin activators derived from snake venom of 
      Tropidechis carinatus and is a rich non-hepatic source of Xa, the only known hepatic 
      prothrombin activator. The structural and functional similarity with Xa makes 
      trocarin an interesting target for exploring the structure-functional relationship 
      with Xa. Herein we report a predicted complete three-dimensional all-atom structural 
      model of trocarin equilibrated in explicit water using 4 ns of molecular dynamics 
      simulation. The tertiary structure was modeled using the structure of human blood 
      coagulation factor Xa. The conformational and structural features of trocarin are 
      then compared with the X-ray crystal and solution simulation structures of human 
      factor Xa. The modeled structure of trocarin has four individual domains (Gla, EGF1, 
      EGF2 and SP) connected along the long axis with similar secondary structural 
      elements to Xa. The simulations suggest that sodium ion binding in the serine 
      protease domain is impaired in trocarin as compared to Xa. In contrast to Xa, for 
      which the sodium ion forms an octahedral coordination network that brings two loop 
      regions connecting four anti-parallel beta-sheets together, we do not find a similar 
      pattern of network in trocarin. We observe that the difference in the binding 
      pattern of sodium ion leads to a approximately 2-A "shrinkage" of the beta2 strand 
      (B2), in comparison to human Xa, as marked by a shorter distance between 189Asp373 
      (S1-site residue) and 195Ser379 (active-site residue) in the B2 strand. We propose 
      that these differences may be linked to the experimentally observed lower amidolytic 
      activity of trocarin as compared to Xa.

TI  - Blockade of Human α7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor by α-Conotoxin ImI Dendrimer: 
      Insight from Computational Simulations.
LID - 10.3390/md17050303 [doi]
LID - 303
AB  - Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are ligand-gated ion channels that are 
      involved in fast synaptic transmission and mediated physiological activities in the 
      nervous system. α-Conotoxin ImI exhibits subtype-specific blockade towards homomeric 
      α7 and α9 receptors. In this study, we established a method to build a 
      2×ImI-dendrimer/h (human) α7 nAChR model, and based on this model, we systematically 
      investigated the molecular interactions between the 2×ImI-dendrimer and hα7 nAChR. 
      Our results suggest that the 2×ImI-dendrimer possessed much stronger potency towards 
      hα7 nAChR than the α-ImI monomer and demonstrated that the linker between α-ImI 
      contributed to the potency of the 2×ImI-dendrimer by forming a stable hydrogen-bond 
      network with hα7 nAChR. Overall, this study provides novel insights into the binding 
      mechanism of α-ImI dendrimer to hα7 nAChR, and the methodology reported here opens 
      an avenue for the design of more selective dendrimers with potential usage as 
      drug/gene carriers, macromolecular drugs, and molecular probes.

TI  - Synchronization of an embryonic network of identified spinal interneurons solely by 
      electrical coupling.
PG  - 1035-46
AB  - There is a need to understand the mechanisms of neural synchronization during 
      development because correlated rhythmic activity is thought to be critical for the 
      establishment of proper connectivity. The relative importance of chemical and 
      electrical synapses for synchronization of electrical activity during development is 
      unclear. We examined the activity patterns of identified spinal neurons at the onset 
      of motor activity in zebrafish embryos. Rhythmic activity appeared early and 
      persisted upon blocking chemical neurotransmission but was abolished by inhibitors 
      of gap junctions. Paired recordings revealed that active spinal neurons were 
      electrically coupled and formed a simple network of motoneurons and a subset of 
      interneurons. Thus, the earliest spinal central pattern generator consists of 
      synchronously active, electrically coupled neurons.

TI  - The Specific Effects of OD-1, a Peptide Activator, on Voltage-Gated Sodium Current 
      and Seizure Susceptibility.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21218254 [doi]
LID - 8254
AB  - OD-1, a scorpion toxin, has been previously recognized as an activator of 
      voltage-gated Na(+) currents. To what extent this agent can alter hippocampal 
      neuronal Na(+) currents and network excitability and how it can be applied to 
      neuronal hyperexcitability research remains unclear. With the aid of patch-clamp 
      technology, it was revealed that, in mHippoE-14 hippocampal neurons, OD-1 produced a 
      concentration-, time-, and state-dependent rise in the peak amplitude of I(Na). It 
      shifted the I(Na) inactivation curve to a less negative potential and increased the 
      frequency of spontaneous action currents. Further characterization of neuronal 
      excitability revealed higher excitability in the hippocampal slices treated with 
      OD-1 as compared with the control slices. A stereotaxic intrahippocampal injection 
      of OD-1 generated a significantly higher frequency of spontaneous seizures and 
      epileptiform discharges compared with intraperitoneal injection of 
      lithium-pilocarpine- or kainic acid-induced epilepsy, with comparable pathological 
      changes. Carbamazepine significantly attenuated OD-1 induced seizures and 
      epileptiform discharges. The OD-1-mediated modifications of I(Na) altered the 
      electrical activity of neurons in vivo and OD-1 could potentially serve as a novel 
      seizure and excitotoxicity model.

      examination proving mast cells infiltration is crucial for the diagnosis of disease. 
      Therapy covers patient education and symptomatic treatment (antihistamine drugs and 
      glicocortycoids). Attempts of interferon, cladribine, imatinib treatment are made. 
      Aggressive forms of diseases require, chemiotherapy, bone marrow transplantation. 
      All mastocytosis subjects should be equipped in adrenaline. The paper describes case 
      of 52 years old woman who suffered from urticaria pigmenthosa, anaphylaxis, insect 
      venom and food allergy. Diagnosis included bone marrow examinations (pathology, 
      cytology, genetics, cytofotometry) tryptase level, skin prick tests and sIgE. 
      Mastocytosis was diagnosed. Therapy included symptomatic treatment and 
      immunotherapy. The paper describes also aims of the European Competence Network on 
      Mastocytosis.

TI  - Solution structure of a novel disintegrin, salmosin, from Agkistrondon halys venom.
PG  - 14408-15
AB  - Disintegrins are potent inhibitors of both platelet aggregation and 
      integrin-dependent cell adhesion. A new disintegrin, salmosin, isolated from the 
      venom of the Korean snake Agkistrodon halys brevicaudus, has been characterized by 
      mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy, and its in vitro biological activity has 
      been assessed. The IC(50) value of the purified salmosin was determined to be 2.2 nM 
      in an assay for the inhibition of glycoprotein IIb-IIIa/fibrinogen interaction. 
      Salmosin also inhibited the bovine capillary endothelial cell proliferation induced 
      by bFGF in a dose-dependent manner. The NMR solution structures were well converged 
      with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.76 A for backbone atoms among the 20 lowest 
      energy structures, except for the arginylglycylaspartic acid (RGD) loop. The 
      structure revealed that the conserved RGD motif with an unusual finger shape is 
      distal from the rigid core of the C-terminal domain. Furthermore, even though the 
      RGD motif did not interact with the hydrophobic core of the protein, it was 
      stabilized by a network of molecular contacts through a small antiparallel 
      beta-sheet comprising residues of Ile46-Ala50 and Asp54-Tyr58. Last, the 
      electrostatic charge distribution on the surface of salmosin differs dramatically 
      from that of other disintegrin proteins in that there is a cluster of negatively 
      charged residues in close proximity to the RGD loop.

TI  - Review of Eastern coral snake (Micrurus fulvius fulvius) exposures managed by the 
      Florida Poison Information Center Network: 1998-2010.
PG  - 783-8
LID - 10.3109/15563650.2013.828841 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Envenomation by the Eastern coral snake is rare but may be associated with 
      significant morbidity. While effective, acquisition of North American Coral Snake 
      Antivenin (NACSAV) is difficult because production was discontinued for many years. 
      OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to characterize coral snake exposures in 
      Florida and determine the effects of varying treatment paradigms on patient 
      outcomes. METHODS: This study is an observational case series of cases received at 
      Florida poison centers. Included cases were Eastern coral snake exposures occurring 
      between January 1, 1998 and October 31, 2010. Excluded cases included those found to 
      be unrelated or those not followed for at least 24 h post envenomation. Case 
      comments were reviewed to obtain data. Comparisons were made between asymptomatic 
      patients receiving empiric antivenom therapy (empiric group) and those asymptomatic 
      patients who received antivenom upon developing signs of systemic envenomation 
      (withhold group). RESULTS: Of the 553 cases identified, 387 were included in the 
      final analysis. According to case comments, 56.3% of patients had no reported 
      systemic symptoms. Most commonly, patients were reported to have pain (40.6%), 
      paresthesias (28.4%), nausea (12.7%), and emesis (11.4%). NACSAV was administered to 
      252 patients (65%). Of those patients receiving NACSAV, 18.25% were reported to have 
      had an adverse reaction. Patients in the withhold group (n = 106) had significantly 
      fewer minor, moderate, and major outcomes than patients in the empiric group (n = 
      134, p < 0.01). DISCUSSION: While patients in the withhold group had favorable 
      outcomes compared with those in the empiric group, this strategy cannot be applied 
      to all patients presenting asymptomatic to healthcare facilities due to study 
      limitations. CONCLUSION: Further studies are needed to determine what treatment 
      strategy is most appropriate for asymptomatic patients presenting to healthcare 
      facilities.

TI  - Surface membrane antigen alteration on blood basophils in patients with Hymenoptera 
      venom allergy under immunotherapy.
PG  - 1190-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Venom immunotherapy (VIT) provides widespread protection against 
      systemic anaphylactic reactions after a sting of the respective insect. This effect 
      is attributed to a shift from T(H)2 to T(H)1. However, because basophils also 
      produce and release cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-13, they may be part of the 
      cytokine network. The cytokines may regulate basophilic granulocytes, as suggested 
      by the presence of cytokine receptors IL-2Ralpha, GM-CSFRalpha, IL-1RII, IL-3R, 
      IL-4R, IL-5R, and IL-6R on basophils from nonallergic donors. OBJECTIVE: The purpose 
      of this study was to demonstrate that human basophils from subjects allergic to wasp 
      venom undergoing VIT are regulated by cytokines, as shown by the alteration of the 
      expression of cytokine receptors (and other markers). METHODS: The expression of the 
      surface interleukin receptors and activation antigens on basophils from 19 
      nonallergic subjects and 48 patients with wasp venom allergy was investigated 
      before, immediately after, and 1 week after VIT (20 patients only). RESULTS: 
      Basophilic granulocytes in allergic subjects, compared with those in healthy 
      persons, showed elevated expression of CD32 (FcgammaRII), CD122 (IL-2Rbeta), CD124 
      (IL-4Ralpha), CD130 (IL-6 and 11Rbeta), CD154 (CD40L), and HLA-DR. Activation of 
      basophils clearly increased during VIT indicated by increased expression of CD32, 
      CD33, CD35 (CR1), CD63, CD116 (GM-CSFRalpha), CD122, CD124, CD130, and CD154. HLA-DR 
      expression also tended to increase. The expression of IL-5R (CD125) decreased. A 
      significant decrease of the basophilic surface antigens CD11c, CD32, CD35, CD63, 
      CD116, CD122, CD124, CD130, and CD132 (interleukin receptor gamma) was detected 1 
      week after the end of rush VIT. CONCLUSION: The rise in CD63 during VIT indicates a 
      partial basophil degranulation with release of stored protein mediators, including 
      IL-4. IL-4 may cause a transient upregulation of different surface antigens in an 
      autocrine manner. Thereafter, cytokines released by T cells, which as a result of 
      VIT have changed from a T(H)2 type to a more T(H)1 type, downregulate the activation 
      of the basophilic granulocytes.

TI  - Efficient enzymatic cyclization of an inhibitory cystine knot-containing peptide.
PG  - 2202-12
LID - 10.1002/bit.25993 [doi]
AB  - Disulfide-rich peptides isolated from cone snails are of great interest as drug 
      leads due to their high specificity and potency toward therapeutically relevant ion 
      channels and receptors. They commonly contain the inhibitor cystine knot (ICK) motif 
      comprising three disulfide bonds forming a knotted core. Here we report the 
      successful enzymatic backbone cyclization of an ICK-containing peptide κ-PVIIA, a 
      27-amino acid conopeptide from Conus purpurascens, using a mutated version of the 
      bacterial transpeptidase, sortase A. Although a slight loss of activity was observed 
      compared to native κ-PVIIA, cyclic κ-PVIIA is a functional peptide that inhibits the 
      Shaker voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel. Molecular modeling suggests that the 
      decrease in potency may be related to the loss of crucial, but previously 
      unidentified electrostatic interactions between the N-terminus of the peptide and 
      the Shaker channel. This hypothesis was confirmed by testing an N-terminally 
      acetylated κ-PVIIA, which shows a similar decrease in activity. We also investigated 
      the conformational dynamics and hydrogen bond network of cyc-PVIIA, both of which 
      are important factors to be considered for successful cyclization of peptides. We 
      found that cyc-PVIIA has the same conformational dynamics, but different hydrogen 
      bond network compared to those of κ-PVIIA. The ability to efficiently cyclize ICK 
      peptides using sortase A will enable future protein engineering for this class of 
      peptides and may help in the development of novel therapeutic molecules. Biotechnol.

TI  - Mechanisms of sharp wave initiation and ripple generation.
PG  - 11385-98
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0867-14.2014 [doi]
AB  - Replay of neuronal activity during hippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SWRs) is 
      essential in memory formation. To understand the mechanisms underlying the 
      initiation of irregularly occurring SWRs and the generation of periodic ripples, we 
      selectively manipulated different components of the CA3 network in mouse hippocampal 
      slices. We recorded EPSCs and IPSCs to examine the buildup of neuronal activity 
      preceding SWRs and analyzed the distribution of time intervals between subsequent 
      SWR events. Our results suggest that SWRs are initiated through a combined 
      refractory and stochastic mechanism. SWRs initiate when firing in a set of 
      spontaneously active pyramidal cells triggers a gradual, exponential buildup of 
      activity in the recurrent CA3 network. We showed that this tonic excitatory envelope 
      drives reciprocally connected parvalbumin-positive basket cells, which start 
      ripple-frequency spiking that is phase-locked through reciprocal inhibition. The 
      synchronized GABA(A) receptor-mediated currents give rise to a major component of 
      the ripple-frequency oscillation in the local field potential and organize the 
      phase-locked spiking of pyramidal cells. Optogenetic stimulation of 
      parvalbumin-positive cells evoked full SWRs and EPSC sequences in pyramidal cells. 
      Even with excitation blocked, tonic driving of parvalbumin-positive cells evoked 
      ripple oscillations. Conversely, optogenetic silencing of parvalbumin-positive cells 
      interrupted the SWRs or inhibited their occurrence. Local drug applications and 
      modeling experiments confirmed that the activity of parvalbumin-positive perisomatic 
      inhibitory neurons is both necessary and sufficient for ripple-frequency current and 
      rhythm generation. These interneurons are thus essential in organizing pyramidal 
      cell activity not only during gamma oscillation, but, in a different configuration, 
      during SWRs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The morbidity of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has increased 
      consistently in recent years. Exenatide could reverse liver fibrosis and lower the 
      occurrence of fatty liver. The aim of the study was to identify and characterize 
      mRNA and miRNA expression to elucidate the mechanism of exenatide in the gerbil 
      model. METHODS: Gerbils were fed a high-fat diet for 8 weeks to induce a fibrosis 
      model; then, the gerbil models were treated with exenatide for 4 weeks. The total 
      RNA extracted from the liver tissue samples was used to prepare the library and 
      sequence on a HiSeq 2000. Bioinformatic methods were employed to analyze the 
      sequence data to identify the mRNAs and miRNAs and to acquire the miRNA-mRNA 
      regulatory network. RESULTS: By RNA-seq, 2344 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
      and 72 miRNAs were found in the model group. Compared with the model group, 591 DEGs 
      and 19 miRNAs were found in the quercetin group, whereas 876 DEGs and 18 miRNAs were 
      found in the treatment group. The miRNA-mRNA regulatory network was constructed in a 
      gerbil model. Immunohistochemistry and RNA sequencing confirmed that the therapeutic 
      effect of exenatide may be derived from extrahepatic signal transduction. The key 
      differential genes are CYP3A, CYP4A11, ACAA1, ACSM, PHX1, MAO, FMO, UGT, ACOX2, 
      ABAT, PIK3C and PLCG1. The key miRNAs are miR-15a, miR-27b, miR-532-3P, miR-627, 
      miR-3596, miR-142-3P, Let-7e-5p, miR-214-5, miR-101-3p, miR-378d. New miRNAs, such 
      as novel_127, novel_143, novel_15, novel_204 are associated with liver fibrosis, 
      while novel_127, novel_15, and novel_54 are associated with reverse treated with 
      exenatide. CONCLUSIONS: Our research represents the first description of mRNA/miRNA 
      profiles in a gerbil model of fatty liver fibrosis treated with exenatide, which may 
      provide insights into the pathogenesis or treatment of the metabolic syndrome.

TI  - [Snake venom proteins related to "vascular endothelial growth factor": new tools for 
      therapeutic angiogenesis].
PG  - 23-37
AB  - The Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor "VEGF" plays a pivotal role in the 
      stimulation of angiogenesis. The VEGF isoforms (A-D) and PlGF act in a coordinate 
      fashion to develop the vascular network. Numerous proteins closely related in 
      structure and function to VEGF-A have been reported and were grouped in the VEGF 
      family. Some predators make use of VEGF-like molecules with devastating results for 
      their prey. VEGF-E, investigated in 1994, is encoded by the parapoxvirus (Orf 
      virus). VEGF-F is a common term designating molecules which were isolated from snake 
      venom (also known as svVEGF). These proteins are disulphide-linked homodimers of 110 
      amino acids each and have a molecular weight of approximately 25 kDa. Their primary 
      structures show approximately 50% identity to VEGF-A. However, unlike VEGF-A, they 
      do not contain any N-linked glycosylation sites. They interact with heparin but have 
      a different binding domain from that of VEGF-A. Among species, these svVEGFs vary 
      extensively in amino acid sequences and in receptor-binding specificities towards 
      endogenous VEGF receptors. Understanding the properties that determine the 
      specificity of these interactions could improve our knowledge of the VEGF-receptor 
      interactions. This knowledge is essential to the development of new drugs in 
      angiogenesis. This knowledge is essential to the development of new drugs in 
      angiogenesis.

TI  - Solution structure of BmKK2, a new potassium channel blocker from the venom of 
      chinese scorpion Buthus martensi Karsch.
PG  - 835-45
AB  - A natural K+ channel blocker, BmKK2 (a member of scorpion toxin subfamily alpha-KTx 
      14), which is composed of 31 amino acid residues and purified from the venom of the 
      Chinese scorpion Buthus martensi Karsch, was characterized using whole-cell 
      patch-clamp recording in rat hippocampal neurons. The three dimensional structure of 
      BmKK2 was determined with two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy and molecular modelling 
      techniques. In solution this toxin adopted a common alpha/beta-motif, but showed 
      distinct local conformation in the loop between alpha-helix and beta-sheet in 
      comparison with typical short-chain scorpion toxins (e.g., CTX and NTX). Also, the 
      alpha helix is shorter and the beta-sheet element is smaller (each strand consisted 
      only two residues). The unusual structural feature of BmKK2 was attributed to the 
      shorter loop between the alpha-helix and beta-sheet and the presence of two 
      consecutive Pro residues at position 21 and 22 in the loop. Moreover, two models of 
      BmKK2/hKv1.3 channel and BmKK2/rSK2 channel complexes were simulated with docking 
      calculations. The results demonstrated the existence of a alpha-mode binding between 
      the toxin and the channels. The model of BmKK2/rSK2 channel complex exhibited 
      favorable contacts both in electrostatic and hydrophobic, including a network of 
      five hydrogen bonds and bigger interface containing seven pairs of inter-residue 
      interactions. In contrast, the model of BmKK2/hKv1.3 channel complex, containing 
      only three pairs of inter-residue interactions, exhibited poor contacts and smaller 
      interface. The results well explained its lower activity towards Kv channel, and 
      predicted that it may prefer a type of SK channel with a narrower entryway as its 
      specific receptor.

TI  - First reports of envenoming by South American water snakes Helicops angulatus and 
      Hydrops triangularis from Bolivian Amazon: A one-year prospective study of 
      non-front-fanged colubroid snakebites.

AB  - Although snakebite incidence is underestimated in Bolivia, the Amazon region 
      presents the highest incidence of these accidents. The local effects of bites by 
      some non-front-fanged colubroid (NFFC) snakes are usually confused with that of 
      viperids, resulting in the improper use of antivenoms and medications. Since there 
      is scarce information on clinical treatment and management of NFFC bites from 
      Bolivian Amazon, we conducted a prospective study of NFFC snakebites by reviewing 
      the records of patients admitted with a snakebite diagnosis at Hospital Central 
      Ivirgarzama, Bolivia. Snakebites were recorded for 12 months (December 2019-November 
      2020), including information about the sex and age of the patient, snakebite date, 
      and treatment. Eight (5.7 %) of 152 patients were bitten by NFFC Helicops angulatus, 
      Hydrops triangularis, and Erythrolamprus sp. Our results showed that 5/7 patients 
      had prolonged clotting time and INR, as well as local edema and mild pain, 
      suggesting systemic envenoming. Previously non-documented mild coagulopathy was 
      observed for H. angulatus and H. triangularis bites. In some cases, incorrect 
      first-aid measures, and inappropriate use of bothropic/lachesic antivenom were 
      administrated. All the patients received supportive therapy and antihistamine drugs. 
      Unsupported use of non-evidence-based treatments for snakebites such as corticoids, 
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and prophylactic antibiotic 
      prescription were recorded. In conclusion, we describe the first formally documented 
      snakebite cases produced by NFFC from Bolivia, highlighting the urgent need for 
      training of the medical team in the snake identification, clinical management of 
      snakebite, and the existence of a human-snake conflict involving NFFC species.

      Envenomation.
PG  - 929-932
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.17-0863 [doi]
AB  - A 47-year-old man was stung on the left ankle by a stingray while on vacation on the 
      Island of Bubaque, Guinea-Bissau. The affected limb was initially treated with an 
      attempt to suck out the venom and application of chewed plant root. The following 3 
      days, local pain gradually diminished, but then high fever erupted together with 
      generalized symptoms and intense pain from the ankle. After initiating antibiotic 
      treatment, the patient was evacuated. Because of sustained symptoms and fever, the 
      wound was surgically debrided, and culture revealed infection with oral flora 
      bacteria. Attempts to suck out venom are not recommended.

TI  - Distortions in protein helices.
PG  - 81-9
AB  - alpha-helices are the most common secondary structures in observed proteins. 
      However, they are not always found in ideal helical conformation and they often 
      exhibit structural distortions. Quantification of these irregularities become 
      essential in understanding the packing of helices and therefore, their role in the 
      functional characteristics of the protein. The backbone torsions phi, psi are of 
      limited utility in this endeavor, because distorted helices often maintain the 
      backbone geometry. The local compensatory effects are responsible for the 
      preservation of the entire hydrogen bond network of the helical stretch. Earlier 
      descriptions of helical linearity and curvature rest mostly on approximation, thus 
      motivating the search for a better method for understanding and quantifying helical 
      irregularities. We developed a method which involves the rotation and superposition 
      of identical repeating units of the protein by the quaternion method. The set of 
      parameters derived from the rotation-superposition algorithm helps in identifying 
      the bends and kinks which are not necessarily induced by unusual amino acids like 
      proline. The quantification of irregularities of observed helices might lead to a 
      better understanding of their packing interactions.

TI  - Health impact of unicellular algae of the Ostreopsis genus blooms in the 
      Mediterranean Sea: experience of the French Mediterranean coast surveillance network 
      from 2006 to 2009.
PG  - 839-44
LID - 10.3109/15563650.2010.513687 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ostreopsis ovata and Ostreopsis siamensis are tropical unicellular algae 
      that have been found recently in the Mediterranean. Both of these dinoflagellates 
      produce palytoxin (PTX)-like toxins that are powerful vasoconstrictors in mammals. 
      Since 2003, Ostreopsis blooms in Italy and Spain have been accompanied by reports of 
      respiratory problems and skin/mucosa irritation in persons in contact with toxic 
      microalgal cells (epiphytes, plankton, or sea spray) or associated toxins. METHODS: 
      In France, a surveillance network has been set up to monitor water conditions and to 
      protect swimmers from contamination due to Ostreopsis. RESULTS: Between 2006 and 
      2009, a total of nine blooms were observed on the French Mediterranean coast 
      including five that led to manifestations in divers, swimmers, and shoreline 
      inhabitants. A total of 47 patients presented symptoms of involving benign or mild 
      skin, mucosal, and/or respiratory irritation that regressed spontaneously without 
      treatment within 12-72 h (4-12 h with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). During 
      the study period, five beaches were temporarily closed. DISCUSSION: In the 
      Mediterranean, Ostreopsis blooms induce skin and respiratory disorders when human 
      beings are exposed to saltwater with a high concentration of algal cells. However, 
      palytoxin dosages carried out on the food chain (urchins, mussels) indicate that 
      this risk of toxins accumulation in seafood must be taken into account and that the 
      surveillance network should be upgraded accordingly.

TI  - Structures of recombinant native and E202Q mutant human acetylcholinesterase 
      complexed with the snake-venom toxin fasciculin-II.
PG  - 1385-94
AB  - Structures of recombinant wild-type human acetylcholinesterase and of its E202Q 
      mutant as complexes with fasciculin-II, a 'three-finger' polypeptide toxin purified 
      from the venom of the eastern green mamba (Dendroaspis angusticeps), are reported. 
      The structure of the complex of the wild-type enzyme was solved to 2.8 A resolution 
      by molecular replacement starting from the structure of the complex of Torpedo 
      californica acetylcholinesterase with fasciculin-II and verified by starting from a 
      similar complex with mouse acetylcholinesterase. The overall structure is 
      surprisingly similar to that of the T. californica enzyme with fasciculin-II and, as 
      expected, to that of the mouse acetylcholinesterase complex. The structure of the 
      E202Q mutant complex was refined starting from the corresponding wild-type human 
      acetylcholinesterase structure, using the 2.7 A resolution data set collected. 
      Comparison of the two structures shows that removal of the charged group from the 
      protein core and its substitution by a neutral isosteric moiety does not disrupt the 
      functional architecture of the active centre. One of the elements of this 
      architecture is thought to be a hydrogen-bond network including residues Glu202, 
      Glu450, Tyr133 and two bridging molecules of water, which is conserved in other 
      vertebrate acetylcholinesterases as well as in the human enzyme. The present 
      findings are consistent with the notion that the main role of this network is the 
      proper positioning of the Glu202 carboxylate relative to the catalytic triad, thus 
      defining its functional role in the interaction of acetylcholinesterase with 
      substrates and inhibitors.

TI  - Inhibitory effect of short cationic homopeptides against Gram-negative bacteria.
PG  - 1445-56
LID - 10.1007/s00726-016-2198-z [doi]
AB  - Previous work demonstrated that Lys homopeptides with an odd number of residues (9, 
      11 and 13) were capable of inhibiting the growth of Gram-positive bacteria in a 
      broader spectrum and more efficiently than those with an even number of Lys residues 
      or Arg homopeptides of the same size. Indeed, all Gram-positive bacteria tested were 
      totally inhibited by 11-residue Lys homopeptides. In the present work, a wide 
      variety of Gram-negative bacteria were used to evaluate the inhibitory activity of 
      chemically synthesized homopeptides of L-Lys and L-Arg ranging from 7 to 14 
      residues. Gram-negative bacteria were comparatively more resistant than 
      Gram-positive bacteria to Lys homopeptides with an odd number of residues, but 
      exhibited a similar inhibition pattern than on Gram-positive bacteria. CD spectra 
      for the odd-numbered Lys homopeptides in anionic lipid 
      dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol, and Escherichia coli membrane extract increased 
      polyproline II content, as compared to those measured in phosphate buffer solution. 
      Lys and Arg homopeptides were covalently linked to rhodamine to visualize the 
      peptide interactions with E. coli cells using confocal laser scanning microscopy. 
      Analysis of Z-stack images showed that Arg homopeptides indeed appear to be 
      localized intracellularly, while the Lys homopeptide is localized exclusively on the 
      plasma membrane. Moreover, these Lys homopeptides induced membrane disruption since 
      the Sytox fluorophore was able to bind to the DNA in E. coli cultures.

AB  - This work is aimed at investigating the effect of melittin on identified key genes 
      in bladder cancer (BC) and further providing a theoretical basis for BC treatment. 
      GSE35014 downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was used to 
      screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in BC cells and control. Results showed 
      that a total of 389 upregulated and 169 downregulated genes were identified. 
      Subsequently, GO analysis, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, and PPI network 
      analysis were employed to disclose the crucial genes and signaling pathways involved 
      in BC. Fifteen module-related DEGs and their associated signaling pathways were 
      obtained according to the PPI network and modular analyses. Based on the analysis of 
      articles retrieved in the PubMed database, we found that melittin could induce 
      apoptosis and constrain the progression of tumor cells as a result of regulating 
      critical cancer-related signaling pathways, such as PI3K-Akt and TNF signaling 
      pathways. Furthermore, PI3K-Akt and TNF signaling pathways were also found to be 
      associated with module-related DEGs according to biological analyses. At last, 
      qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that melittin could constrain the expression of 
      module-related DEGs (LPAR1, COL5A1, COL6A2, CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL3) associated with 
      PI3K-Akt and TNF signaling pathways in BC cells. Functional assays revealed that 
      melittin could constrain the proliferative and migrated abilities of BC cells. 
      Conjointly, these findings provide a theoretical basis for these six genes as 
      drug-sensitive markers of melittin in BC treatment.

AB  - Fatalities among avian species due to multiple bee stings are rare. Sixteen pigeons 
      on a farm in Bangladesh each suffered multiple bee stings. Ten of the pigeons died 
      before treatment, 5 (4-11 stings) died within 12 hr after treatment, and 1 pigeon 
      (only 3 stings) survived. Body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, 
      hematocrit, hemoglobin, erythrocytes, thrombocytes, MCV, MCH and MCHC decreased 
      significantly after the incident, but leucocytes, heterophils, basophils, 
      eosinophils, monocytes, ALT, AST, LDH, CK, creatinine, BUN and UA increased 
      markedly. Overall, the hematological and biochemical changes in the bee-stung 
      pigeons were similar to those of mammals; however, avian species may be more 
      sensitive to bee stings than mammals.

TI  - Molecular basis of cardiotoxicity upon cobra envenomation.
PG  - 105-18
AB  - Various clinical manifestations leading to death have been documented in most cases 
      of bites caused by venomous snakes. Cobra envenomation is an extremely variable 
      process and known to cause profound neurological abnormalities. The complexity of 
      cobra venom can induce multiple-organ failure, leading to death in case of severe 
      envenomation. Intramuscular administration of Malayan spitting cobra (Naja 
      sputatrix) crude venom at 1 microg/g dose caused death in mice in approximately 3 h. 
      Analysis of gene expression profiles in the heart, brain, kidney, liver and lung 
      revealed 203 genes whose expression was altered by at least 3-fold in response to 
      venom treatment. Of these, 50% were differentially expressed in the heart and 
      included genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, ion transport and energy 
      metabolism. Electrocardiogram recordings and serum troponin T measurements indicated 
      declining cardiac function and myocardial damage. This not only sheds light on the 
      cardiotoxicity of cobra venom but also reveals the molecular networks affected 
      during envenomation.

AB  - The mammalian circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is a 
      heterogeneous structure. Two key populations of cells that receive retinal input and 
      are believed to participate in circadian responses to light are cells that contain 
      vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP). VIP 
      acts primarily through the VPAC2 receptor, while GRP works primarily through the BB2 
      receptor. Both VIP and GRP phase shift the circadian clock in a manner similar to 
      light when applied to the SCN, both in vivo and in vitro, indicating that they are 
      sufficient to elicit photic-like phase shifts. However, it is not known if they are 
      necessary signals for light to elicit phase shifts. Here we test the hypothesis that 
      GRP and VIP are necessary signaling components for the photic phase shifting of the 
      hamster circadian clock by examining two antagonists for each of these 
      neuropeptides. The BB2 antagonist PD176252 had no effect on light-induced delays on 
      its own, while the BB2 antagonist RC-3095 had the unexpected effect of significantly 
      potentiating both phase delays and advances. Neither of the VIP antagonists 
      ([d-p-Cl-Phe6, Leu17]-VIP, or PG99-465) altered phase shifting responses to light on 
      their own. When the BB2 antagonist PD176252 and the VPAC2 antagonist PG99-465 were 
      delivered together to the SCN, phase delays were significantly attenuated. These 
      results indicate that photic phase shifting requires participation of either VIP or 
      GRP; phase shifts to light are only impaired when signalling in both pathways are 
      inhibited. Additionally, the unexpected potentiation of light-induced phase shifts 
      by RC-3095 should be investigated further for potential chronobiotic applications.

AB  - Spontaneous activity driven by "pacemaker" neurons, defined by their intrinsic 
      ability to generate rhythmic burst firing, contributes to the development of sensory 
      circuits in many regions of the immature CNS. However, it is unknown whether 
      pacemaker-like neurons are present within central pain pathways in the neonate. 
      Here, we provide evidence that a subpopulation of glutamatergic interneurons within 
      lamina I of the rat spinal cord exhibits oscillatory burst firing during early life, 
      which occurs independently of fast synaptic transmission. Pacemaker neurons were 
      distinguished by a higher ratio of persistent, voltage-gated Na(+) conductance to 
      leak membrane conductance (g(Na,P)/g(leak)) compared with adjacent, nonbursting 
      lamina I neurons. The activation of high-threshold (N-type and L-type) voltage-gated 
      Ca(2+) channels also facilitated rhythmic burst firing by triggering intracellular 
      Ca(2+) signaling. Bursting neurons received direct projections from high-threshold 
      sensory afferents but transmitted nociceptive signals with poor fidelity while in 
      the bursting mode. The observation that pacemaker neurons send axon collaterals 
      throughout the neonatal spinal cord raises the possibility that intrinsic burst 
      firing could provide an endogenous drive to the developing sensorimotor networks 
      that mediate spinal pain reflexes.

TI  - Functional insights from the GC-poor genomes of two aphid parasitoids, Aphidius ervi 
      and Lysiphlebus fabarum.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Parasitoid wasps have fascinating life cycles and play an important role 
      in trophic networks, yet little is known about their genome content and function. 
      Parasitoids that infect aphids are an important group with the potential for 
      biological control. Their success depends on adapting to develop inside aphids and 
      overcoming both host aphid defenses and their protective endosymbionts. RESULTS: We 
      present the de novo genome assemblies, detailed annotation, and comparative analysis 
      of two closely related parasitoid wasps that target pest aphids: Aphidius ervi and 
      Lysiphlebus fabarum (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Aphidiinae). The genomes are small 
      (139 and 141 Mbp) and the most AT-rich reported thus far for any arthropod (GC 
      content: 25.8 and 23.8%). This nucleotide bias is accompanied by skewed codon usage 
      and is stronger in genes with adult-biased expression. AT-richness may be the 
      consequence of reduced genome size, a near absence of DNA methylation, and energy 
      efficiency. We identify missing desaturase genes, whose absence may underlie mimicry 
      in the cuticular hydrocarbon profile of L. fabarum. We highlight key gene groups 
      including those underlying venom composition, chemosensory perception, and sex 
      determination, as well as potential losses in immune pathway genes. CONCLUSIONS: 
      These findings are of fundamental interest for insect evolution and biological 
      control applications. They provide a strong foundation for further functional 
      studies into coevolution between parasitoids and their hosts. Both genomes are 
      available at https://bipaa.genouest.org.

TI  - Raised Intracellular Calcium Contributes to Ischemia-Induced Depression of Evoked 
      Synaptic Transmission.

LID - e0148110
AB  - Oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) leads to depression of evoked synaptic 
      transmission, for which the mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that 
      increased presynaptic [Ca2+]i during transient OGD contributes to the depression of 
      evoked field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs). Additionally, we 
      hypothesized that increased buffering of intracellular calcium would shorten 
      electrophysiological recovery after transient ischemia. Mouse hippocampal slices 
      were exposed to 2 to 8 min of OGD. fEPSPs evoked by Schaffer collateral stimulation 
      were recorded in the stratum radiatum, and whole cell current or voltage clamp 
      recordings were performed in CA1 neurons. Transient ischemia led to increased 
      presynaptic [Ca2+]i, (shown by calcium imaging), increased spontaneous miniature 
      EPSP/Cs, and depressed evoked fEPSPs, partially mediated by adenosine. Buffering of 
      intracellular Ca2+ during OGD by membrane-permeant chelators (BAPTA-AM or EGTA-AM) 
      partially prevented fEPSP depression and promoted faster electrophysiological 
      recovery when the OGD challenge was stopped. The blocker of BK channels, 
      charybdotoxin (ChTX), also prevented fEPSP depression, but did not accelerate 
      post-ischemic recovery. These results suggest that OGD leads to elevated presynaptic 
      [Ca2+]i, which reduces evoked transmitter release; this effect can be reversed by 
      increased intracellular Ca2+ buffering which also speeds recovery.

TI  - Multiscale prediction of patient-specific platelet function under flow.
PG  - 190-8
LID - 10.1182/blood-2011-10-388140 [doi]
AB  - During thrombotic or hemostatic episodes, platelets bind collagen and release ADP 
      and thromboxane A(2), recruiting additional platelets to a growing deposit that 
      distorts the flow field. Prediction of clotting function under hemodynamic 
      conditions for a patient's platelet phenotype remains a challenge. A platelet 
      signaling phenotype was obtained for 3 healthy donors using pairwise agonist 
      scanning, in which calcium dye-loaded platelets were exposed to pairwise 
      combinations of ADP, U46619, and convulxin to activate the P2Y(1)/P2Y(12), TP, and 
      GPVI receptors, respectively, with and without the prostacyclin receptor agonist 
      iloprost. A neural network model was trained on each donor's pairwise agonist 
      scanning experiment and then embedded into a multiscale Monte Carlo simulation of 
      donor-specific platelet deposition under flow. The simulations were compared 
      directly with microfluidic experiments of whole blood flowing over collagen at 200 
      and 1000/s wall shear rate. The simulations predicted the ranked order of drug 
      sensitivity for indomethacin, aspirin, MRS-2179 (a P2Y(1) inhibitor), and iloprost. 
      Consistent with measurement and simulation, one donor displayed larger clots and 
      another presented with indomethacin resistance (revealing a novel heterozygote 
      TP-V241G mutation). In silico representations of a subject's platelet phenotype 
      allowed prediction of blood function under flow, essential for identifying 
      patient-specific risks, drug responses, and novel genotypes.

TI  - Texas coral snake (Micrurus tener) bites.
PG  - 152-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical features of bites from Texas coral snakes (Micrurus tener) 
      have not been well studied. Our goal was to review the largest number of victims of 
      Texas coral snakebites to determine their characteristics, effects, treatment, and 
      outcome. METHODS: Retrospective case series of Micrurus tener exposures reported to 
      the Texas Poison Center Network from 2000 to 2004. RESULTS: Eighty-two patients were 
      included in the analysis. Most (57.3%) were 18 to 49-year-old men. Almost 90% had 
      local swelling, pain, erythema, or paresthesias. Only 7.3% had systemic effects, and 
      none of these were severe. Over half received coral snake antivenin, and 15.9% were 
      given opioids for pain. No patient died and no patient required mechanical 
      ventilation due to hypoventilation from the snakebite. CONCLUSIONS: There were more 
      local findings and less severe systemic effects than previously reported. Antivenin 
      is not needed for most of these patients, and opioids may be administered safely.

AB  - BRS-3 has an important role in glucose homeostasis. Its expression was reduced in 
      skeletal muscle from obese and/or diabetic patients, and BRS-3 KO-mice developed 
      obesity. In this work, focused on rat/human adipose tissue, BRS-3 gene-expression 
      was lower than normal-levels in hyperlipidemic, type-2-diabetic (T2D), and 
      type-1-diabetic rats and also in obese (OB) and T2D patients. Moreover, BRS-3 
      protein levels were decreased in diabetic rat and in obese and diabetic human fat 
      pieces; but neither mutation nor even polymorphism in the BRS-3-gene was found in OB 
      or T2D patients. Interestingly, in rat and human adipocytes, without metabolic

AB  - Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is the main systemic complication and cause of death in 
      viperid envenomation. Although there are hypotheses for the development of AKI, the 
      mechanisms involved are still not established. The aim of this study was to evaluate 
      the clinical-laboratorial-epidemiological factors associated with AKI in victims of 
      Bothrops sp envenomation. This is an observational study carried out at the Fundação 
      de Medicina Tropical Dr. Heitor Vieira Dourado. AKI was defined according to the 
      guidelines of the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN). Among the 186 patients 
      evaluated, AKI was observed in 24 (12.9%) after 48 hours of admission. Stage I was 
      present in 17 (70.8%) patients, II in 3 (12.5%) and III in 4 (16.7%). 
      Epidemiological characterization showed predominance of men, occurrence in rural 
      areas, aged between 16-60 years, feet as the most affected anatomical region, and 
      time to medical assistance less than 3 hours. Hypertension and diabetes were the 
      comorbidities identified. Most of the accidents were classified as moderate, and 
      clinical manifestations included severe pain, mild edema, local bleeding and 
      headache. Laboratory results showed blood uncoagulability, hypofibrinogenemia, 
      leukocytosis, increase of creatine kinase, and high lactate dehydrogenase levels. 
      Multivariate analysis showed an association with high LDH levels [AOR = 1.01 (95% CI 
      = 1.01-1.01, p<0.002)], local bleeding [AOR = 0.13 (95%CI = 0.027-0.59, p<0.009)], 
      and the presence of comorbidities [AOR = 60.96 (95%CI = 9.69-383.30; p<0.000)]. 
      Herein, laboratory markers such as high LDH levels along with local bleeding and 
      comorbidities may aid in the diagnosis of AKI.

TI  - Binding of alpha-thrombin to fibrin depends on the quality of the fibrin network.
PG  - 157-63
AB  - Binding of human alpha-thrombin to fibrin was studied in a purified system at pH 
      7.35, I 0.08 and 37 degrees C. Binding experiments with active thrombin resulted in 
      fibrin clots of variable quality, depending on the thrombin concentration: opaque 
      gels composed of 'coarse' network were produced at low thrombin concentrations, 
      while increasing concentrations of thrombin led to more translucent 'fine' gels. 
      Scatchard analysis showed a non-linear dependence of thrombin binding to fibrin, 
      suggesting the existence in fibrin(ogen) of multiple classes of binding sites for 
      thrombin. Binding of catalytic-site-inhibited thrombin was investigated in clots of 
      defined quality produced with three different concentrations of a thrombin-like 
      enzyme, batroxobin (EC 3.4.21.29). Straight lines of different slopes were 
      established by Scatchard analysis of binding data at each fixed batroxobin 
      concentration. These results favour a model according to which binding affinity for 
      thrombin depends on the thickness of fibrin bundles. Labelled 
      active-site-inactivated thrombin incorporated in batroxobin-induced clots was only 
      sparingly released during incubation for 24 h in the presence of a 200-fold excess 
      of unlabelled thrombin, indicating that thrombin binding to fibrin is not reversible 
      and that Scatchard analysis is not appropriate for quantification of binding 
      parameters. Irreversible binding of thrombin appears to reflect trapping of thrombin 
      molecules within fibrin fibres. The amount of trapped thrombin depends on the 
      quality of the fibrin fibres, which in turn is determined by the concentration of 
      the clotting enzyme.

TI  - The Parotoid Gland Secretion from Peruvian Toad Rhinella horribilis (Wiegmann, 
      1833): Chemical Composition and Effect on the Proliferation and Migration of Lung 
      Cancer Cells.

AB  - Since Rhinella sp. toads produce bioactive substances, some species have been used 
      in traditional medicine and magical practices by ancient cultures in Peru. During 
      several decades, the Rhinella horribilis toad was confused with the invasive toad 
      Rhinella marina, a species documented with extensive toxinological studies. In 
      contrast, the chemical composition and biological effects of the parotoid gland 
      secretions (PGS) remain still unknown for R. horribilis. In this work, we determine 
      for the first time 55 compounds from the PGS of R. horribilis, which were identified 
      using HPLC-MS/MS. The crude extract inhibited the proliferation of A549 cancer cells 
      with IC(50) values of 0.031 ± 0.007 and 0.015 ± 0.001 µg/mL at 24 and 48 h of 
      exposure, respectively. Moreover, it inhibited the clonogenic capacity, increased 
      ROS levels, and prevented the etoposide-induced apoptosis, suggesting that the 
      effect of R. horribilis poison secretion was by cell cycle blocking before of 
      G2/M-phase checkpoint. Fraction B was the most active and strongly inhibited cancer 
      cell migration. Our results indicate that the PGS of R. horribilis are composed of 
      alkaloids, bufadienolides, and argininyl diacids derivatives, inhibiting the 
      proliferation and migration of A549 cells.

TI  - Effects of microinjections of neurotoxin AvTx8, isolated from the social wasp 
      Agelaia vicina (Hymenoptera, Vespidae) venom, on GABAergic nigrotectal pathways.
PG  - 74-81
AB  - Several investigations have provided information that defensive behaviors evoked by 
      stimulation of deep layers of the superior colliculus (dlSC) are subjected to 
      inhibitory nigral modulation. This inhibition is made mainly through GABAergic 
      neurons from substantia nigra, pars reticulata (SNpr), that sends outputs toward 
      neural networks of the deep layers of the superior colliculus and dorsal 
      periaqueductal gray matter involved with the organization of fear-like responses. In 
      this work, we compared the effects of two GABAergic agonists, muscimol and baclofen, 
      with the effect of neurotoxin AvTx8 (1567 Da), isolated from the venom of the social 
      wasp Agelaia vicina, microinjected into SNpr of Rattus norvegicus (Wistar rats) 
      prior to dlSC saline or bicuculline microinjections, considering that wasp venom has 
      some influence on the uptake of GABA and/or glutamate neurotransmitters. GABA(A) 
      receptor blockade in the dlSC evoked a vigorous escape behavior, expressed by rapid 
      running, jumps and turns, as compared to control. These defensive reactions were 
      maximized after the intranigral GABA(A) agonism with muscimol, but not after in situ 
      GABA(B) agonism. Nigral microinjection of AvTx8 induced similar effects to those of 
      baclofen, decreasing the intensity of behavioral defensive reactions caused by 
      GABA(A) receptor blockade in the dorsal mesencephalon. These findings suggest that 
      AvTx8 has some effects on GABAergic neurotransmission, increasing the activity of 
      the inhibitory nigro-collicular pathways, causing an anti-panic (antiaversive) 
      effect. Therefore, our work suggests AvTx8 as a novel pharmacological tool to study 
      differences between the two types of GABAergic receptors and excitatory amino 
      acid-mediated mechanisms in the brain and brainstem networks.

TI  - Pharmacological modulation of SK3 channels.
PG  - 879-87
AB  - Small-conductance, calcium-activated K+ channels (SK channels) are 
      voltage-insensitive channels that have been identified molecularly within the last 
      few years. As SK channels play a fundamental role in most excitable cells and 
      participate in afterhyperpolarization (AHP) and spike-frequency adaptation, 
      pharmacological modulation of SK channels may be of significant clinical importance. 
      Here we report the functional expression of SK3 in HEK293 and demonstrate a broad 
      pharmacological profile for these channels. Brain slice studies commonly employ 
      4-aminopyridine (4-AP) to block voltage-dependent K+ channels or a methyl derivative 
      of bicuculline, a blocker of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-gated Cl- channels, in 
      order to investigate the role of various synapses in specialized neural networks. 
      However, in this study both 4-AP and bicuculline are shown to inhibit SK3 channels 
      (IC50 values of 512 microM and 6 microM, respectively) at concentrations lower than 
      those used for brain slice recordings. Riluzole, a potent neuroprotective drug with 
      anti-ischemic, anticonvulsant and sedative effects currently used in the treatment 
      of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, activates SK3 channels at concentrations of 3 
      microM and above. Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressive widely used clinically, 
      inhibits SK3 channels with an IC50 of 39.1 +/- 10 microM (n=6).

TI  - Antigen stability controls antigen presentation.
PG  - 50257-66
AB  - We investigated whether protein stability controls antigen presentation using a four 
      disulfide-containing snake toxin and three derivatives carrying one or two mutations 
      (L1A, L1A/H4Y, and H4Y). These mutations were anticipated to increase (H4Y) or 
      decrease (L1A) the antigen non-covalent stabilizing interactions, H4Y being 
      naturally and frequently observed in neurotoxins. The chemically synthesized 
      derivatives shared similar three-dimensional structure, biological activity, and T 
      epitope pattern. However, they displayed differential thermal unfolding capacities, 
      ranging from 65 to 98 degrees C. Using these differentially stable derivatives, we 
      demonstrated that antigen stability controls antigen proteolysis, antigen processing 
      in antigen-presenting cells, T cell stimulation, and kinetics of expression of T 
      cell determinants. Therefore, non-covalent interactions that control the unfolding 
      capacity of an antigen are key parameters in the efficacy of antigen presentation. 
      By affecting the stabilizing interaction network of proteins, some natural mutations 
      may modulate the subsequent T-cell stimulation and might help microorganisms to 
      escape the immune response.

TI  - Structural basis of citrate-dependent and heparan sulfate-mediated cell surface 
      retention of cobra cardiotoxin A3.
PG  - 9567-77
AB  - Anionic citrate is a major component of venom, but the role of venom citrate in 
      toxicity other than its inhibitory effect on the cation-dependent action of venom 
      toxins is poorly understood. By immobilizing Chinese hamster ovary cells in 
      microcapillary tubes and heparin on sensor chips, we demonstrated that heparan 
      sulfate-mediated cell retention of the major cardiotoxin (CTX) from the Taiwan 
      cobra, CTX A3, near membrane surfaces is citrate-dependent. X-ray determination of a 
      CTX A3-heparin hexasaccharide complex structure at 2.4 A resolution revealed a 
      molecular mechanism for toxin retention in which heparin-induced conformational 
      changes of CTX A3 lead to citrate-mediated dimerization. A citrate ion bound to 
      Lys-23 and Lys-31 near the tip of loop II stabilizes hydrophobic contact of the CTX 
      A3 homodimer at the functionally important loop I and II regions. Additionally, the 
      heparin hexasaccharide interacts with five CTX A3 molecules in the crystal 
      structure, providing another mechanism whereby the toxin establishes a complex 
      network of interactions that result in a strong interaction with cell surfaces 
      presenting heparan sulfate. Our results suggest a novel role for venom citrate in 
      biological activity and reveal a structural model that explains cell retention of 
      cobra CTX A3 through heparan sulfate-CTX interactions.

AB  - Natrin, a new member of the cysteine-rich secretory protein (CRISP) family purified 
      from the snake venom of Naja naja atra, has been demonstrated to have anticancer 
      activity. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms need further elucidation. In 
      this study, MTT was used to evaluate cell viability. Apoptotic cells were analyzed 
      by employing a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Metabolomic study of the 
      metabolic perturbations caused by natrin-induced apoptosis in differentiated 
      SMMC-7721 cells was performed for the first time by using integrative 
      ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass 
      spectrometry (UPLC-Q/TOF MS). To investigate the possible mechanism in the 
      mitochondrial pathway of natrin-induced apoptosis, we measured apoptosis-related 
      mRNA changes using real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (FQ-PCR). Cell 
      proliferation was significantly inhibited after treatment with natrin in a 
      dose-dependent manner. Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least 
      squares-discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) clearly demonstrated that metabolic profiles 
      were affected by natrin. The results of multivariate statistical analysis showed 
      that a total of 13 metabolites were characterized as potential biomarkers highly 
      implicated in natrin-induced apoptosis, which corresponded to fluctuations of five 
      pathways, including sphingolipid metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis, fatty acid 
      metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism and glycosphingolipid biosynthesis. 
      Furthermore, natrin-induced apoptosis showed an increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in 
      the mitochondrial pathway compared with controls. This study illustrated that rapid 
      and holistic cell metabolomics combining molecular biological approaches might be a 
      powerful tool for evaluating the underlying mechanisms of natrin-induced apoptosis, 
      which would help to deepen specific insights into the anti-hepatoma mechanisms of 
      natrin and facilitate the clinical application of natrin in the future.

TI  - NMR and restrained molecular dynamics study of the three-dimensional solution 
      structure of toxin FS2, a specific blocker of the L-type calcium channel, isolated 
      from black mamba venom.
PG  - 5923-37
AB  - The three-dimensional solution structure of toxin FS2, a 60-residue polypeptide 
      isolated from the venom of black mamba snake (Dendroaspis polylepis polylepis), has 
      been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Using 600 NOE 
      constraints and 55 dihedral angle constraints, a set of 20 structures obtained from 
      distance-geometry calculations was further refined by molecular dynamics 
      calculations using a combined simulated annealing-restrained MD protocol. The 
      resulting 20 conformers, taken to represent the solution structure, give an average 
      rmsd of 1.2 A for their backbone atoms, relative to the average structure. The 
      overall resulting three-fingered structure is similar to those already observed in 
      several postsynaptic neurotoxins, cardiotoxins, and fasciculins, which all share 
      with toxin FS2 the same network of four disulfide bridges. The overall concavity of 
      the molecule, considered as a flat bottomed dish, is oriented toward the C-terminal 
      loop of the molecule. This orientation is similar to that of fasciculins and 
      cardiotoxins but opposite to that of neurotoxins. On the basis of the local rms 
      displacements between the 20 conformers, the structure of the first loop appears to 
      be less well defined in FS2 than in the previously reported neurotoxin structures, 
      but fasciculin 1 shows a similar trend with particularly high temperature factors 
      for this part of the X-ray structure. The concave side which presents most of the 
      positively charged residues is quite similar in FS2 and fasciculin 1. The main 
      difference is shown by the convex side of the third loop, mostly hydrophobic in FS2, 
      in contrast to the pair of negatively charged aspartates in fasciculin 1. This 
      difference could be one of the factors leading to the distinct pharmacological 
      properties-L-type calcium channel blocker for FS2 and cholinesterase inhibitor for 
      fasciculin--observed for these two subgroups of the "angusticeps-type" toxins.

AB  - The neurotoxicity of two secreted Phospholipases A2 from Brazilian coral snake venom 
      in rat primary hippocampal cell culture was investigated. Following exposure to 
      Mlx-8 or Mlx-9 toxins, an increase in free cytosolic Ca(2+) and a reduction in 
      mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) became evident and occurred prior to the 
      morphological changes and cytotoxicity. Exposure of hippocampal neurons to Mlx-8 or 
      Mlx-9 caused a decrease in the cell viability as assessed by MTT and LDH assays. 
      Inspection using fluorescent images and ultrastructural analysis by scanning and 
      transmission electron microscopy showed that multiphase injury is characterized by 
      overlapping cell death phenotypes. Shrinkage, membrane blebbing, chromatin 
      condensation, nucleosomal DNA fragmentation and the formation of apoptotic bodies 
      were observed. The most striking alteration observed in the electron microscopy was 
      the fragmentation and rarefaction of the neuron processes network. Degenerated 
      terminal synapses, cell debris and apoptotic bodies were observed among the 
      fragmented fibers. Numerous large vacuoles as well as swollen mitochondria and 
      dilated Golgi were noted. Necrotic signs such as a large amount of cellular debris 
      and membrane fragmentation were observed mainly when the cells were exposed to 
      highest concentration of the PLA2-neurotoxins. PLA2s exposed cultures showed 
      cytoplasmic vacuoles filled with cell debris, clusters of mitochondria presented 
      mitophagy-like structures that are in accordance to patterns of programmed cell 
      death by autophagy. Finally, we demonstrated that the sPLA2s, Mlx-8 and Mlx-9, 
      isolated from the Micrurus lemniscatus snake venom induce a hybrid cell death with 
      apoptotic, autophagic and necrotic features. Furthermore, this study suggests that 
      the augment in free cytosolic Ca(2+) and mitochondrial dysfunction are involved in 
      the neurotoxicity of Elapid coral snake venom sPLA2s.

TI  - Active site of bee venom phospholipase A2: the role of histidine-34, aspartate-64 
      and tyrosine-87.
PG  - 4591-601
AB  - In bee venom phospholipase A2, histidine-34 probably functions as a Brønsted base to 
      deprotonate the attacking water. Aspartate-64 and tyrosine-87 form a hydrogen 
      bonding network with histidine-34. We have prepared mutants at these positions and 
      studied their kinetic properties. The mutant in which histidine-34 is changed to 
      glutamine is catalytically inactive, while the mutants in which aspartate-64 is 
      changed to asparagine or alanine (interfacial turnover numbers are reduced by 
      50-100-fold) or in which tyrosine-87 is changed to phenylalanine (no change in 
      turnover number) retain good activity. The interfacial Michaelis constants are 
      changed by less than 10-fold for all mutants. Molecular simulations suggest that 
      mutation of aspartate-64 and tyrosine-87 should yield enzymes that retain a 
      native-like structure and support catalysis. The pKa of the histidine-34 imidazole 
      was deduced from the pH-rate profile and from the pH dependence of the rate of 
      histidine-34 alkylation by 2-bromo-4'-nitroacetophenone. The pKa is increased about 
      one-half unit by the tyrosine-87 mutation and reduced about one-half unit by the 
      aspartate-64 to asparagine mutation, while in the aspartate-64 to alanine mutant the 
      pKa is unchanged. These pKas are generally consistent with results of electrostatic 
      calculations and suggest that the hydrogen bond between aspartate-64 and 
      histidine-34 is not unusually strong. The hydrogen bonding network linking 
      tyrosine-87 to aspartate-64 and aspartate-64 to histidine-34 is not critical for 
      catalysis.

TI  - Impaired Reliability and Precision of Spiking in Adults But Not Juveniles in a Mouse 
      Model of Fragile X Syndrome.
LID - ENEURO.0217-19.2019 [pii]
LID - 10.1523/ENEURO.0217-19.2019 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common source of intellectual disability and 
      autism. Extensive studies have been performed on the network and behavioral 
      correlates of the syndrome, but our knowledge about intrinsic conductance changes is 
      still limited. In this study, we show a differential effect of FMRP knockout in 
      different subsections of hippocampus using whole-cell patch clamp in mouse 
      hippocampal slices. We observed no significant change in spike numbers in the CA1 
      region of hippocampus, but a significant increase in CA3, in juvenile mice. However, 
      in adult mice we see a reduction in spike number in the CA1 with no significant 
      difference in CA3. In addition, we see increased variability in spike numbers in CA1 
      cells following a variety of steady and modulated current step protocols. This 
      effect emerges in adult mice (8 weeks) but not juvenile mice (4 weeks). This 
      increased spiking variability was correlated with reduced spike number and with 
      elevated AHP. The increased AHP arose from elevated SK currents (small conductance 
      calcium-activated potassium channels), but other currents involved in medium AHP, 
      such as I (h) and M, were not significantly different. We obtained a partial rescue 
      of the cellular variability phenotype when we blocked SK current using the specific 
      blocker apamin. Our observations provide a single-cell correlate of the network 
      observations of response variability and loss of synchronization, and suggest that 
      the elevation of SK currents in FXS may provide a partial mechanistic explanation 
      for this difference.

TI  - Infantile spasms in down syndrome: Rescue by knockdown of the GIRK2 channel.
PG  - 511-21
LID - 10.1002/ana.24749 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Ts65Dn (Ts) mouse model of Down syndrome (DS) is exquisitely 
      sensitive to an infantile spasms phenotype induced by γ-aminobutyric acidB receptor 
      (GABAB R) agonists. The Ts mouse contains the core genomic triplication of the DS 
      critical region, which includes 3 copies of the Kcnj6 gene that encodes the GABAB 
      R-coupled G protein-coupled inward rectifying potassium channel subunit 2 (GIRK2) 
      channel. We test the hypothesis that GIRK2 is necessary for the GABAB R 
      agonist-induced infantile spasms phenotype in Ts. METHODS: We assessed the result of 
      either genetic or pharmacological knockdown of the GIRK2 channel in Ts brain upon 
      the GABAB R agonist-induced infantile spasms phenotype in the Ts mouse model of DS. 
      As well, we examined GABAB R currents in hippocampal neurons prepared from 
      GIRK2-trisomic Ts control mice and GIRK2-disomic Ts mice in which Kcnj6 had been 
      genetically knocked down from 3 to 2 copies. RESULTS: The reduction of the copy 
      number of Kcnj6 in Ts mice rescued the GABAB R agonist-induced infantile spasms 
      phenotype. There was an increase in GABAB R-mediated GIRK2 currents in 
      GIRK2-trisomic Ts mouse hippocampal neurons, which were normalized in the 
      GIRK2-disomic Ts mice. Similarly, pharmacological knockdown of the GIRK2 channel in 
      Ts brain using the GIRK antagonist tertiapin-Q also rescued the GABAB R 
      agonist-induced infantile spasms phenotype in Ts mutants. INTERPRETATION: The GABAB 
      R-coupled GIRK2 channel is necessary for the GABAB R agonist-induced infantile 
      spasms phenotype in the Ts mouse and may represent a novel therapeutic target for 
      the treatment of infantile spasms in DS. Ann Neurol 2016;80:511-521.

TI  - Similar effectiveness of dapagliflozin and GLP-1 receptor agonists concerning 
      combined endpoints in routine clinical practice: A multicentre retrospective study.
PG  - 1886-1894
LID - 10.1111/dom.13747 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: According to cardiovascular outcome trials, some sodium-glucose 
      contransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists 
      (GLP-1RA) are recommended for secondary cardiovascular prevention in type 2 diabetes 
      (T2D). In this real-world study, we compared the simultaneous reductions in HbA1c, 
      body weight and systolic blood pressure after initiation of dapagliflozin or GLP-1RA 
      as second or a more advanced line of therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DARWIN-T2D was 
      a retrospective multi-centre study conducted at diabetes specialist clinics in Italy 
      that compared T2D patients who initiated dapagliflozin or GLP-1RA (exenatide once 
      weekly or liraglutide). Data were collected at baseline and at the first follow-up 
      visit after 3 to 12 months. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients 
      achieving a simultaneous reduction in HbA1c, body weight and systolic blood 
      pressure. To reduce confounding, we used multivariable adjustment (MVA) or 
      propensity score matching (PSM). RESULTS: Totals of 473 patients initiating 
      dapagliflozin and 336 patients initiating GLP-1RA were included. The two groups 
      differed in age, diabetes duration, HbA1c, weight and concomitant medications. The 
      median follow-up was 6 months in both groups. Using MVA or PSM, the primary endpoint 
      was observed in 30% to 32% of patients, with no difference between groups. 
      Simultaneous reduction of HbA1c, BP and SBP by specific threshold, as well as 
      achievement of final goals, did not differ between groups. GLP-1RA reduced HbA1c by 
      0.3% more than the reduction achieved with dapagliflozin. CONCLUSION: In routine 
      specialist care, initiation of dapagliflozin can be as effective as initiation of a 
      GLP-1RA for attainment of combined risk factor goals.

TI  - Differential effects of potassium channel blockers on the activity of the locomotor 
      network in neonatal rat.
PG  - 185-97
AB  - The role played by various K+ channels during locomotor activity was studied using 
      an in vitro neonatal rat spinal cord preparation. Locomotor-like activity was 
      elicited by bath-applying serotonin (5-HT) and N-methyl-d-l-aspartate (NMA). Four 
      different K+ channel blockers were tested by adding them to the superfusing saline. 
      Each of the K+ channel blockers elicited a characteristic motor pattern with 
      specific temporal parameters. Cs+ and tetraethyl ammonium both decreased the motor 
      period, but had opposite effects on the burst amplitude. Apamin increased both the 
      motor period and the burst amplitude. A dose-response relationship was established 
      for the K+ channel blockers. The blockers elicited an unstable rhythmic activity, 
      contrary to what occurred under control conditions. We also found that due to the 
      specific changes that they elicit, the various blockers produce selective changes in 
      the burst ratio. These results suggest that the various K+ channels contribute 
      differently to the generation of locomotor activity.

TI  - Comparative effectiveness of exenatide once-weekly versus liraglutide in routine

      observational studies.
PG  - 1255-1260
LID - 10.1111/dom.13623 [doi]
AB  - In this study, we retrospectively compared the effectiveness of exenatide 
      once-weekly (ExeOW) versus liraglutide in non-insulin treated patients with type 2 
      diabetes followed under routine care. We also present a meta-analysis of similar 
      observational studies available in the literature. In our multicentre retrospective 
      study, patients initiating ExeOW (n = 204) or liraglutide (n = 410) had similar 
      baseline clinical characteristics. Change in HbA1c at 6 months was superimposable in 
      the two groups (-0.7% ± 1.0%), and changes in body weight were also similar (ExeOW 
      -2.2 ± 3.7 kg; liraglutide -2.5 ± 4.3 kg; p = 0.457). Discontinuation rates were 
      numerically but not significantly lower for ExeOW versus liraglutide. Pooling these 
      data with those of observational studies available in the literature yielded 
      superimposable effects between the two groups for the change in HbA1c and body 
      weight, with a higher risk of discontinuation (mainly based on pharmacy refill 
      rates) for ExeOW. We conclude that, in patients under routine care, initiation of 
      ExeOW provides similar benefits on HbA1c and body weight as initiation of 
      liraglutide. These data help view the results of randomized controlled trials from 
      the perspective of their application in routine clinical practice.

TI  - Allergen IgE-isotype-specific suppression by maternally derived monoclonal 
      anti-IgG-idiotype.
PG  - 16-23
LID - 10.1111/j.1398-9995.2009.02104.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The dramatic increase of IgE-mediated allergic diseases in western 
      countries demonstrates the urgent need for new therapeutic or prophylactic 
      approaches. In mice, a prophylactic long-lasting allergen-specific suppression of 
      IgE responsiveness is induced by maternal IgG antibodies to allergens like 
      ovalbumin, phospholipase A(2) (bvPLA(2)) or ovomucoid. As neonatal application or 
      maternally derived pathogen-reactive antibodies (idiotypes) as well as corresponding 
      anti-idiotypes can induce anti-microbial protection, we probed the transgenerational 
      IgE-suppressive mechanism with a syngeneic monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibody. 
      METHODS: The monoclonal bee-venom-phospholipase A(2) (bvPLA(2))-reactive IgG 
      antibody MS613 (idiotype) or the corresponding syngeneic anti-idiotype II/2-19 were 
      injected during the first 2 days postpartum to the dams. Immunization of offspring 
      with minute doses of IgE-inducing bvPLA(2) was started at an adult age of 3(1/2) 
      months. RESULTS: The postnatal transfer of the anti-bvPLA(2) idiotype MS613 or the 
      corresponding anti-idiotype II/2-19 induced long-lasting allergen-specific IgE 
      suppression in a dose-dependent manner, while the IgG response to the allergen 
      developed normally. Quantitatively, the anti-idiotype was more effective than 
      idiotype. Molecular modeling of the idiotype-anti-idiotype complex and its 
      comparison with the bvPLA(2) structure revealed that the anti-idiotype does not 
      mimic bvPLA(2) epitopes and thus can not be regarded as an internal image antibody 
      and, consequently, does not function as a surrogate antigen. CONCLUSIONS: Idiotypic 
      network reactivity is at least one major factor for induction of transgenerational 
      IgE suppression by maternal IgG antibodies. If applicable to humans, these data 
      suggest the possibility of a prophylactic and possibly therapeutic treatment of 
      IgE-mediated allergic diseases with anti-idiotypic antibodies.

TI  - Influence of honeybee sting on peptidome profile in human serum.
PG  - 1808-20
LID - 10.3390/toxins7051808 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to explore the serum peptide profiles from honeybee stung 
      and non-stung individuals. Two groups of serum samples obtained from 27 beekeepers 
      were included in our study. The first group of samples was collected within 3 h 
      after a bee sting (stung beekeepers), and the samples were collected from the same 
      person a second time after at least six weeks after the last bee sting (non-stung 
      beekeepers). Peptide profile spectra were determined using MALDI-TOF mass 
      spectrometry combined with Omix, ZipTips and magnetic beads based on weak-cation 
      exchange (MB-WCX) enrichment strategies in the mass range of 1-10 kDa. The samples 
      were classified, and discriminative models were established by using the quick 
      classifier, genetic algorithm and supervised neural network algorithms. All of the 
      statistical algorithms used in this study allow distinguishing analyzed groups with 
      high statistical significance, which confirms the influence of honeybee sting on the 
      serum peptidome profile. The results of this study may broaden the understanding of 
      the human organism's response to honeybee venom. Due to the fact that our pilot 
      study was carried out on relatively small datasets, it is necessary to conduct 
      further proteomic research of the response to honeybee sting on a larger group of 
      samples.

TI  - Snakebite in Australia: a practical approach to diagnosis and treatment.
PG  - 763-8
AB  - Snakebite is a potential medical emergency and must receive high-priority assessment 
      and treatment, even in patients who initially appear well. Patients should be 
      treated in hospitals with onsite laboratory facilities, appropriate antivenom stocks 
      and a clinician capable of treating complications such as anaphylaxis. All patients 
      with suspected snakebite should be admitted to a suitable clinical unit, such as an 
      emergency short-stay unit, for at least 12 hours after the bite. Serial blood 
      testing (activated partial thromboplastin time, international normalised ratio and 
      creatine kinase level) and neurological examinations should be done for all 
      patients. Most snakebites will not result in significant envenoming and do not 
      require antivenom. Antivenom should be administered as soon as there is evidence of 
      envenoming. Evidence of systemic envenoming includes venom-induced consumption 
      coagulopathy, sudden collapse, myotoxicity, neurotoxicity, thrombotic 
      microangiopathy and renal impairment. Venomous snake groups each cause a 
      characteristic clinical syndrome, which can be used in combination with local 
      geographical distribution information to determine the probable snake involved and 
      appropriate antivenom to use. The Snake Venom Detection Kit may assist in regions 
      where the range of possible snakes is too broad to allow the use of monovalent 
      antivenoms. When the snake identification remains unclear, two monovalent antivenoms 
      (eg, brown snake and tiger snake antivenom) that cover possible snakes, or a 
      polyvalent antivenom, can be used. One vial of the relevant antivenom is sufficient 
      to bind all circulating venom. However, recovery may be delayed as many clinical and 
      laboratory effects of venom are not immediately reversible. For expert advice on 
      envenoming, contact the National Poisons Information Centre on 13 11 26.

AB  - Inadequate pancreatic β cell function underlies type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
      Strategies to expand functional cells have focused on discovering and controlling 
      mechanisms that limit the proliferation of human β cells. Here, we developed an 
      engraftment strategy to examine age-associated human islet cell replication 
      competence and reveal mechanisms underlying age-dependent decline of β cell 
      proliferation in human islets. We found that exendin-4 (Ex-4), an agonist of the 
      glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R), stimulates human β cell proliferation in 
      juvenile but not adult islets. This age-dependent responsiveness does not reflect 
      loss of GLP-1R signaling in adult islets, since Ex-4 treatment stimulated insulin 
      secretion by both juvenile and adult human β cells. We show that the mitogenic 
      effect of Ex-4 requires calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) 
      signaling. In juvenile islets, Ex-4 induced expression of calcineurin/NFAT signaling 
      components as well as target genes for proliferation-promoting factors, including 
      NFATC1, FOXM1, and CCNA1. By contrast, expression of these factors in adult islet β 
      cells was not affected by Ex-4 exposure. These studies reveal age-dependent 
      signaling mechanisms regulating human β cell proliferation, and identify elements 
      that could be adapted for therapeutic expansion of human β cells.

PG  - 609-18
LID - 10.1089/dia.2013.0177 [doi]
AB  - A recent autopsy analysis asserted that incretin drugs have the potential of 
      increasing the risk for pancreatic cancer and for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. 
      We examined the Network for Pancreatic Organ Donors with Diabetes (nPOD) database 
      from which that analysis was derived. Our findings raise important questions about 
      the comparability of the two groups of diabetes patients used for the analysis. Our 
      review of the data available on the nPOD Web site and our reading of the earlier 
      article lead us to the conclusion that the data, and the implications of the data, 
      as expressed by the authors of the autopsy analysis are vastly overstated and are a 
      misrepresentation of the information available.

TI  - The aryl hydrocarbon receptor links integrin signaling to the TGF-β pathway.

AB  - Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive form of intrinsic brain tumor. 
      Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β represents a central mediator of the malignant 
      phenotype of these tumors by promoting invasiveness and angiogenesis, maintaining 
      tumor cell stemness and inducing profound immunosuppression. Integrins, which are 
      highly expressed in glioma cells, interact with the TGF-β pathway. Furthermore, a 
      link has been described between activity of the transcription factor aryl 
      hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and TGF-β expression. Here we demonstrate that integrin 
      inhibition, using αv, β3 or β5 neutralizing antibodies, RNA interference-mediated 
      integrin gene silencing or pharmacological inhibition by the cyclic RGD peptide EMD 
      121974 (cilengitide) or the non-peptidic molecule GLPG0187, inhibits AhR activity. 
      These effects are independent of cell detachment or cell density. While AhR mRNA 
      expression was not affected by integrin inhibition, AhR total and nuclear protein 
      levels were reduced, suggesting that integrin inhibition-mediated regulation of AhR 
      may occur at a post-transcriptional level. AhR-null astrocytes, AhR-null hepatocytes 
      or glioblastoma cells with a transiently silenced AhR gene showed reduced 
      sensitivity to integrin inhibition-mediated alterations in TGF-β signaling, 
      indicating that AhR mediates integrin control of the TGF-β pathway. Accordingly, 
      there was a significant correlation of αv integrin levels with nuclear AhR and 
      pSmad2 levels as determined by immunohistochemistry in human glioblastoma in vivo. 
      In summary, this study identifies a signaling network comprising integrins, AhR and 
      TGF-β and validates integrin inhibition as a promising strategy not only to inhibit 
      angiogenesis, but also to block AhR- and TGF-β-controlled features of malignancy in 
      human glioblastoma.

AB  - The antitumour effect of melittin (MEL) has recently attracted considerable 
      attention. Nonetheless, information regarding the functional role of MEL in bladder 
      cancer (BC) is currently limited. Herein, we investigated the effect of MEL on 
      critical module genes identified in BC. In total, 2015 and 4679 differentially 
      expressed genes (DEGs) associated with BC were identified from the GSE31189 set and 
      The Cancer Genome Atlas database, respectively. GSE-identified DEGs were mapped and 
      analysed using Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes analyses 
      to determine BC-involved crucial genes and signal pathways. Coupled with 
      protein-protein interaction network and Molecular Complex Detection analyses, 
      Modules 2 and 4 were highlighted in the progression of BC. In in-vitro experiments, 
      MEL inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of UM-UC-3 and 5637 cells. 
      The expression of NRAS, PAK2, EGFR and PAK1 in Module 4-enriched in the MAPK 
      signalling pathway-was significantly reduced after treatment with MEL at 
      concentrations of 4 or 6 μg/mL. Finally, quantitative reverse 
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting analyses revealed MEL 
      inhibited the expression of genes at the mRNA (ERK1/2, ERK5, JNK and MEK5), protein 
      (ERK5, MEK5, JNK and ERK1/2) and phosphorylation (p-ERK1/2, p-JNK, and p-38) levels. 
      This novel evidence indicates MEL exerts effects on the ERK5-MAK pathway-a branch of 
      MAPK signalling pathway. Collectively, these findings provide a theoretical basis 
      for MEL application in BC treatment.

TI  - Dopamine D1 receptor modulation of calcium channel currents in horizontal cells of 
      mouse retina.
PG  - 686-97
LID - 10.1152/jn.00990.2015 [doi]
AB  - Horizontal cells form the first laterally interacting network of inhibitory 
      interneurons in the retina. Dopamine released onto horizontal cells under photic and 
      circadian control modulates horizontal cell function. Using isolated, identified 
      horizontal cells from a connexin-57-iCre × ROSA26-tdTomato transgenic mouse line, we 
      investigated dopaminergic modulation of calcium channel currents (ICa) with whole 
      cell patch-clamp techniques. Dopamine (10 μM) blocked 27% of steady-state ICa, an 
      action blunted to 9% in the presence of the L-type Ca channel blocker verapamil (50 
      μM). The dopamine type 1 receptor (D1R) agonist SKF38393 (20 μM) inhibited ICa by 
      24%. The D1R antagonist SCH23390 (20 μM) reduced dopamine and SKF38393 inhibition. 
      Dopamine slowed ICa activation, blocking ICa by 38% early in a voltage step. 
      Enhanced early inhibition of ICa was eliminated by applying voltage prepulses to 
      +120 mV for 100 ms, increasing ICa by 31% and 11% for early and steady-state 
      currents, respectively. Voltage-dependent facilitation of ICa and block of dopamine 
      inhibition after preincubation with a Gβγ-blocking peptide suggested involvement of 
      Gβγ proteins in the D1R-mediated modulation. When the G protein activator guanosine 
      5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS) was added intracellularly, ICa was smaller and 
      showed the same slowed kinetics seen during D1R activation. With GTPγS in the 
      pipette, additional block of ICa by dopamine was only 6%. Strong depolarizing 
      voltage prepulses restored the GTPγS-reduced early ICa amplitude by 36% and 
      steady-state ICa amplitude by 3%. These results suggest that dopaminergic inhibition 
      of ICa via D1Rs is primarily mediated through the action of Gβγ proteins in 
      horizontal cells.

TI  - 5-HT3a Receptors Modulate Hippocampal Gamma Oscillations by Regulating Synchrony of 
      Parvalbumin-Positive Interneurons.
PG  - 576-85
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhu209 [doi]
AB  - Gamma-frequency oscillatory activity plays an important role in information 
      integration across brain areas. Disruption in gamma oscillations is implicated in 
      cognitive impairments in psychiatric disorders, and 5-HT3 receptors (5-HT3Rs) are 
      suggested as therapeutic targets for cognitive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders. 
      Using a 5-HT3aR-EGFP transgenic mouse line and inducing gamma oscillations by 
      carbachol in hippocampal slices, we show that activation of 5-HT3aRs, which are 
      exclusively expressed in cholecystokinin (CCK)-containing interneurons, selectively 
      suppressed and desynchronized firings in these interneurons by enhancing 
      spike-frequency accommodation in a small conductance potassium 
      (SK)-channel-dependent manner. Parvalbumin-positive interneurons therefore received 
      diminished inhibitory input leading to increased but desynchronized firings of PV 
      cells. As a consequence, the firing of pyramidal neurons was desynchronized and 
      gamma oscillations were impaired. These effects were independent of 5-HT3aR-mediated 
      CCK release. Our results therefore revealed an important role of 5-HT3aRs in gamma 
      oscillations and identified a novel crosstalk among different types of interneurons 
      for regulation of network oscillations. The functional link between 5-HT3aR and 
      gamma oscillations may have implications for understanding the cognitive impairments 
      in psychiatric disorders.

TI  - Calcium-dependent potassium channels play a critical role for burst termination in 
      the locomotor network in lamprey.
PG  - 1852-61
AB  - 1. The possible involvement of calcium-dependent potassium channels (KCa) in the 
      termination of locomotor bursts was investigated by administration of a specific 
      blocker, apamin, in the lamprey spinal cord in vitro. The effects were examined by 
      recording the efferent activity in ventral roots and by intracellular recording from 
      interneurons and motoneurons. During fictive locomotion induced by 
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), apamin was found to affect both the frequency of 
      bursting and the regularity of the locomotor pattern. 2. At the single cell level, 
      NMDA can induce pacemaker-like membrane potential oscillations in individual neurons 
      after administration of tetrodotoxin. Apamin (2.5 microM) produced a marked increase 
      of the duration of the depolarizing plateau phase occurring during these 
      NMDA-induced oscillations; this shows that the repolarization of the plateau is 
      initiated by a progressive activation of apamin-sensitive KCa-channels. 3. The 
      action potential is followed by an afterhyperpolarization (AHP) with a fast and a 
      slow phase (sAHP). The latter is known to be caused by apamin-sensitive 
      KCa-channels. During repetitive firing, the interspike interval is dependent on the 
      amplitude and the duration of the sAHP. Apamin caused a reduction of the spike 
      frequency adaptation with a concomitant increase in the firing frequency. In some 
      cells, apamin in addition reduced the threshold for the action potential. 
      Apamin-sensitive KCa-channels thus will be involved in controlling both the onset 
      and the duration of neuronal firing in the lamprey spinal cord. 4. During fictive 
      locomotion induced by NMDA (40-200 microM), a blockade of KCa-channels by apamin 
      produced an increase of the coefficient of variation (mean = 167%, n = 26), which 
      was statistically significant in 21 out of 26 experiments. At 40-150 microM NMDA, an 
      average increase in cycle duration was 77% and statistically significant in 15 out 
      of 20 preparations. At 200 microM NMDA (corresponding to higher burst rate), on the 
      other hand, the average increase was only 6% and the increase was statistically 
      significant in only 1 out 6 cases. For a given experiment, the strength of the 
      apamin effect depended on the level of NMDA drive used, being more pronounced at 
      slow rhythms, when it often caused a complete disruption of the locomotor pattern. 
      At high burst rates, however, the cycle duration was less affected and a disruption 
      of the regular burst pattern did not occur.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accumulating clinical and preclinical evidence indicates that chronic 
      pain is often comorbid with persistent low mood and anxiety. However, the mechanisms 
      underlying pain-induced anxiety, such as its causality, temporal progression, and 
      relevant neural networks are poorly understood, impeding the development of 
      efficacious therapeutic approaches. RESULTS: Here, we have identified the sequential 
      emergence of anxiety phenotypes in mice subjected to dental pulp injury (DPI), a 
      prototypical model of orofacial pain that correlates with human toothache. Compared 
      with sham controls, mice subjected to DPI by mechanically exposing the pulp to the 
      oral environment exhibited significant signs of anxiogenic effects, specifically, 
      altered behaviors on the elevated plus maze (EPM), novelty-suppressed feeding (NSF) 
      tests at 1 but not 3 days after the surgery. Notably, at 7 and 14 days, the DPI mice 
      again avoided the open arm, center area, and novelty environment in the EPM, open 
      field, and NSF tests, respectively. In particular, DPI-induced social phobia and 
      increased repetitive grooming did not occur until 14 days after surgery, suggesting 
      that DPI-induced social anxiety requires a long time. Moreover, oral administration 
      of an anti-inflammatory drug, ibuprofen, or an analgesic agent, ProTx-II, which is a 
      selective inhibitor of NaV1.7 sodium channels, both significantly alleviated 
      DPI-induced avoidance in mice. Finally, to investigate the underlying central 
      mechanisms, we pharmacologically blocked a popular form of synaptic plasticity with 
      a GluA2-derived peptide, long-term depression, as that treatment significantly 
      prevented the development of anxiety phenotype upon DPI. CONCLUSIONS: Together, 
      these results suggest a temporally progressive causal relationship between orofacial 
      pain and anxiety, calling for more in-depth mechanistic studies on concomitant pain 
      and anxiety disorders.

AB  - Short-term studies in subjects with diabetes receiving glucagon-like peptide 1 
      (GLP-1)-targeted therapies have suggested a reduced number of cardiovascular events. 
      The mechanisms underlying this unexpectedly rapid effect are not known. We cloned 
      full-length GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) mRNA from a human megakaryocyte cell line 
      (MEG-01), and found expression levels of GLP-1Rs in MEG-01 cells to be higher than 
      those in the human lung but lower than in the human pancreas. Incubation with GLP-1 
      and the GLP-1R agonist exenatide elicited a cAMP response in MEG-01 cells, and 
      exenatide significantly inhibited thrombin-, ADP-, and collagen-induced platelet 
      aggregation. Incubation with exenatide also inhibited thrombus formation under flow 
      conditions in ex vivo perfusion chambers using human and mouse whole blood. In a 
      mouse cremaster artery laser injury model, a single intravenous injection of 
      exenatide inhibited thrombus formation in normoglycemic and hyperglycemic mice in 
      vivo. Thrombus formation was greater in mice transplanted with bone marrow lacking a 
      functional GLP-1R (Glp1r(-/-)), compared with those receiving wild-type bone marrow. 
      Although antithrombotic effects of exenatide were partly lost in mice transplanted 
      with bone marrow from Glp1r(-/-) mice, they were undetectable in mice with a genetic 
      deficiency of endothelial nitric oxide synthase. The inhibition of platelet function 
      and the prevention of thrombus formation by GLP-1R agonists represent potential 
      mechanisms for reduced atherothrombotic events.

TI  - Interaction of rat α9α10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor with α-conotoxin RgIA and

AB  - The α9α10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is an effective therapeutic 
      target for neuropathic pain. α-Conotoxin RgIA and Vc1.1 are two well-known peptides 
      blocking α9α10 nAChR potently and selectively, which have been extensively 
      investigated as drug candidates. Several key residues were established in previous 
      experimental research. However, the mechanism of the specific interaction still 
      needs to be elucidated in more detail. In this work, we explored the interaction 
      mechanism between RgIA/Vc1.1 and rat α9α10 nAChR using docking and molecular 
      dynamics (MD) simulations. Energy and network analysis programs were used to reveal 
      key residues responsible for their interaction. Our results indicated that the most 
      critical residues were in accord with previous studies. Importantly, several novel 
      residues, including Tyr95, Trp151 in α9 (+)α10 (-) interface as well as Tyr196, 
      Arg59in α10 (+)α9 (-) interface, were found in our models. Furthermore, we analyzed 
      noncovalent interaction energies between RgIA/Vc1.1 and rat α9α10 nAChR. The results 
      showed that three negatively charged residues (Glu197 in α10 subunit, Asp168 in α9 
      subunit and Asp205 in α10 subunit) were involved in the interaction between RgIA and 
      rat α9α10 nAChR. In contrast, the interaction between Vc1.1 and rat α9α10 nAChR was 
      mediated by the positively charged residues Arg59, Arg81 in α9 (-) subunit. These 
      findings provided further insights into the molecular mechanisms of interaction 
      between RgIA and Vc1.1 and rat α9α10 nAChR.

TI  - GLP-1R Agonists Modulate Enteric Immune Responses Through the Intestinal 
      Intraepithelial Lymphocyte GLP-1R.
PG  - 2537-49
LID - 10.2337/db14-1577 [doi]
AB  - Obesity and diabetes are characterized by increased inflammation reflecting 
      disordered control of innate immunity. We reveal a local intestinal intraepithelial 
      lymphocyte (IEL)-GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) signaling network that controls mucosal 
      immune responses. Glp1r expression was enriched in intestinal IEL preparations and 
      copurified with markers of Tαβ and Tγδ IELs, the two main subsets of intestinal 
      IELs. Exendin-4 increased cAMP accumulation in purified IELs and reduced the 
      production of cytokines from activated IELs but not from splenocytes ex vivo. These 
      actions were mimicked by forskolin, absent in IELs from Glp1r(-/-) mice, and 
      attenuated by the GLP-1R agonist exendin (9-39) consistent with a GLP-1R-dependent 
      mechanism of action. Furthermore, Glp1r(-/-) mice exhibited dysregulated intestinal 
      gene expression, an abnormal representation of microbial species in feces, and 
      enhanced sensitivity to intestinal injury following administration of dextran sodium 
      sulfate. Bone marrow transplantation using wild-type C57BL/6 donors normalized 
      expression of multiple genes regulating immune function and epithelial integrity in 
      Glp1r(-/-) recipient mice, whereas acute exendin-4 administration robustly induced 
      the expression of genes encoding cytokines and chemokines in normal and injured 
      intestine. Taken together, these findings define a local enteroendocrine-IEL axis 
      linking energy availability, host microbial responses, and mucosal integrity to the 
      control of innate immunity.

TI  - Redox-active injectable gel using polyion complex to achieve sustained release of 
      exenatide and enhance therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 1107-1113
LID - 10.1002/jbm.a.36647 [doi]
AB  - To provide sustained release of exenatide and enhance therapeutic efficacy for the 
      treatment of type 2 diabetes compared to the existing products for exenatide, we 
      developed an exenatide-loaded, redox-active, injectable gel (Exe@RIG). This 
      injectable gel is formed by a polyion complex (PIC) comprising three components, (1) 
      cationic polyamine-poly(ethylene glycol)-polyamine triblock copolymer possessing 
      reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging moieties as side chains, (2) anionic 
      poly(acrylic acid), and (3) exenatide. The mixture formed exenatide-loaded PIC 
      flower micelles at room temperature, which immediately converted to a gel under 
      physiological conditions. Owing to electrostatic interactions between exenatide and 
      the PIC gel network, RIG was able to provide sustained release of exenatide without 
      a significant initial burst. Subcutaneous injection of Exe@RIG once a week prevented 
      the increase in glucose concentration significantly in db/db mice compared to those 
      in control groups. In addition, Exe@RIG suppressed the degeneration of pancreatic 
      islets, which is reported to be caused by increased ROS. Our result indicates that 
      Exe@RIG has the potential to provide a long acting exenatide as well as enhanced 
      efficacy in the treatment of type 2 diabetes compared to the existing products. ©

LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2900 [doi]
AB  - We determined the X-ray crystal structures of the extracellular domain (ECD) of the 
      monomeric state of human neuronal α9 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and of 
      its complexes with the antagonists methyllycaconitine and α-bungarotoxin at 
      resolutions of 1.8 Å, 1.7 Å and 2.7 Å, respectively. The structure of the monomeric 
      α9 ECD superimposed well with the structures of homologous proteins in pentameric 
      assemblies, denoting native folding, despite the absence of a complementary subunit 
      and transmembrane domain. The interaction motifs of both antagonists were similar to 
      those in the complexes with homologous pentameric proteins, thus highlighting the 
      major contribution of the principal side of α9 ECD to their binding. The structures 
      revealed a functionally important β7-β10 strand interaction in α9-containing nAChRs, 
      involving their unique Thr147, a hydration pocket similar to that of mouse α1 ECD 
      and a membrane-facing network coordinated by the invariant Arg210.

TI  - Rhodocetin-αβ-induced neuropilin-1-cMet association triggers restructuring of matrix 
      contacts in endothelial cells.
PG  - 544-54
LID - 10.1161/ATVBAHA.112.00006 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The snake venom component rhodocetin-αβ (RCαβ) stimulates endothelial 
      cell motility in an α2β1 integrin-independent manner. We aimed to elucidate its 
      cellular and molecular mechanisms. METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified neuropilin-1 
      (Nrp1) as a novel target of RCαβ by protein-chemical methods. RCαβ and vascular 
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A avidly bind to Nrp1. Instead of acting as VEGF 
      receptor 2 coreceptor, Nrp1 associates upon RCαβ treatment with cMet. Furthermore, 
      cell-based ELISAs and kinase inhibitor studies showed that RCαβ induces 
      phosphorylation of tyrosines 1234/1235 [corrected] and thus activation of cMet. 
      Consequently, paxillin is phosphorylated at Y31, which is redistributed from 
      streak-like focal adhesions to spot-like focal contacts at the cell perimeter, along 
      with α2β1 integrin, thereby regulating cell-matrix interactions. Cortactin is 
      abundant in the cell perimeter, where it is involved in the branching of the 
      cortical actin network of lamellipodia, whereas tensile force-bearing actin stress 
      fibers radiating from focal adhesions disappear together with zyxin, a focal 
      adhesion marker, on RCαβ treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that (1) Nrp1 
      is a novel target for venom components, such as RCαβ; (2) Nrp1 coupled to cMet 
      regulates the type of cell-matrix interactions in a manner involving paxillin 
      phosphorylation; and (3) altered cell-matrix interactions determine endothelial cell 
      migration and cellular force management.

TI  - [Bacterial toxins: useful for studying G-proteins implicated in the mechanism of 
      exocytosis in neuroendocrine cells].
PG  - 451-6
AB  - In neuroendocrine cells, regulated exocytosis is a multistep process that comprises 
      the recruitment and priming of secretory granules, their docking to the exocytotic 
      sites, and the subsequent fusion of granules with the plasma membrane leading to the 
      release of secretory products into the extracellular space. Using bacterial toxins 
      which specially inactivate subsets of G proteins, we were able to demonstrate that 
      both trimeric and monomeric G proteins directly control the late stages of 
      exocytosis in chromaffin cells. Indeed, in secretagogue-stimulated chromaffin cells, 
      the subplasmalemmal actin cytoskeleton undergoes a specific reorganization that is a 
      prerequisite for exocytosis. Our results suggest that a granule-bound trimeric Go 
      protein controls the actin network surrounding secretory granules through a pathway 
      involving the GTPase RhoA and a downstream phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase. 
      Furthermore, the GTPase Cdc42 plays a active role in exocytosis, most likely by 
      providing specific actin structures to the late docking and/or fusion steps. We 
      propose that G proteins tightly control secretion in neuroendocrine cells by 
      coupling the actin cytoskeleton to the sequential steps underlying membrane 
      trafficking at the site of exocytosis. Our data highlight the use of bacterial 
      toxins, which proved to be powerful tools to dissect the exocytotic machinery at the 
      molecular level.

AB  - To increase the power of X-ray crystallography to determine not only the structures 
      but also the motions of biomolecules, we developed methods to address two classic 
      crystallographic problems: putting electron density maps on the absolute scale of 
      e(-)/Å(3) and calculating the noise at every point in the map. We find that noise 
      varies with position and is often six to eight times lower than thresholds currently 
      used in model building. Analyzing the rescaled electron density maps from 485 
      representative proteins revealed unmodeled conformations above the estimated noise 
      for 45% of side chains and a previously hidden, low-occupancy inhibitor of HIV 
      capsid protein. Comparing the electron density maps in the free and nucleotide-bound 
      structures of three human protein kinases suggested that substrate binding perturbs 
      distinct intrinsic allosteric networks that link the active site to surfaces that 
      recognize regulatory proteins. These results illustrate general approaches to 
      identify and analyze alternative conformations, low-occupancy small molecules, 
      solvent distributions, communication pathways, and protein motions.

TI  - Effects of C-Terminal Carboxylation on α-Conotoxin LsIA Interactions with Human α7 
      Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor: Molecular Simulation Studies.
LID - 10.3390/md17040206 [doi]
LID - 206
AB  - α-Conotoxins selectively bind to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which 
      are therapeutic targets due to their important role in signaling transmission in 
      excitable cells. A previous experimental study has demonstrated that carboxylation 
      of the C-terminal of α-conotoxin LsIA reduces its potency to inhibit human α7 nAChR 
      relative to naturally amidated LsIA. However, little is known about the contribution 
      of conformational changes in the receptor and interactions, induced by C-terminal 
      amidation/carboxylation of conotoxins, to selective binding to nAChRs, since most 
      conotoxins and some disulfide-rich peptides from other conotoxin subfamilies possess 
      a naturally amidated C-terminal. In this study, we employ homology modeling and 
      molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to propose the determinants for differential 
      interactions between amidated and carboxylated LsIAs with α7 nAChR. Our findings 
      indicate an overall increased number of contacts favored by binding of amidated LsIA 
      versus its carboxylated counterpart. Toxin-receptor pairwise interactions, which may 
      play a role in enhancing the potency of the former, include ARG10-TRP77, LEU141 and 
      CYS17-GLN79 via persistent hydrogen bonds and cation-π interactions, which are 
      weakened in the carboxylated form due to a strong intramolecular salt-bridge formed 
      by ARG10 and carboxylated C-terminus. The binding of amidated LsIA also induces 
      enhanced movements in loop C and the juxtamembrane Cys-loop that are closely 
      associated with receptor function. Additionally, the impacts of binding of LsIA on 
      the overall structure and inter-subunit contacts were examined using inter-residue 
      network analysis, suggesting a clockwise tilting of the α7 C and F loops upon 
      binding to carboxylated LsIA, which is absent for amidated LsIA binding. The 
      predicted molecular mechanism of LsIA binding to the α7 receptor may provide new 
      insights into the important role of the C-terminal in the binding potency of 
      conotoxins at neuronal nAChRs for pharmacological purposes.

TI  - L-type calcium channels refine the neural population code of sound level.
PG  - 2550-2563
LID - 10.1152/jn.00657.2016 [doi]
AB  - The coding of sound level by ensembles of neurons improves the accuracy with which 
      listeners identify how loud a sound is. In the auditory system, the rate at which 
      neurons fire in response to changes in sound level is shaped by local networks. 
      Voltage-gated conductances alter local output by regulating neuronal firing, but 
      their role in modulating responses to sound level is unclear. We tested the effects 
      of L-type calcium channels (Ca(L): Ca(V)1.1-1.4) on sound-level coding in the 
      central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICC) in the auditory midbrain. We 
      characterized the contribution of Ca(L) to the total calcium current in brain slices 
      and then examined its effects on rate-level functions (RLFs) in vivo using 
      single-unit recordings in awake mice. Ca(L) is a high-threshold current and 
      comprises ∼50% of the total calcium current in ICC neurons. In vivo, Ca(L) activates 
      at sound levels that evoke high firing rates. In RLFs that increase monotonically 
      with sound level, Ca(L) boosts spike rates at high sound levels and increases the 
      maximum firing rate achieved. In different populations of RLFs that change 
      nonmonotonically with sound level, Ca(L) either suppresses or enhances firing at 
      sound levels that evoke maximum firing. Ca(L) multiplies the gain of monotonic RLFs 
      with dynamic range and divides the gain of nonmonotonic RLFs with the width of the 
      RLF. These results suggest that a single broad class of calcium channels activates 
      enhancing and suppressing local circuits to regulate the sensitivity of neuronal 
      populations to sound level.

TI  - Masking epilepsy by combining two epilepsy genes.
PG  - 1554-8
AB  - Inherited errors in ion channel genes comprise the largest subset of monogenic 
      causes of idiopathic epilepsy, and pathogenic variants contribute to genetic risk in 
      the complex inheritance of this common disorder. We generated a digenic mouse model 
      of human idiopathic epilepsy by combining two epilepsy-associated ion channel 
      mutations with mutually opposing excitability defects and overlapping subcellular 
      localization. We found that increasing membrane excitability by removing Shaker-like 
      K(+) channels, which are encoded by the Kcna1 gene, masked the absence epilepsy 
      caused by a P/Q-type Ca(2+) channelopathy due to a missense mutation in the Cacna1a 
      gene. Conversely, decreasing network excitability by impairing Cacna1a 
      Ca(2+)-channel function attenuated limbic seizures and sudden death in Kcna1-null 
      mice. We also identified intermediate excitability phenotypes at the network and 
      axonal levels. Protective interactions between pathogenic ion channel variants may 
      markedly alter the clinical expression of epilepsy, highlighting the need for 
      comprehensive profiling of this candidate gene set to improve the accuracy of 
      genetic risk assessment of this complex disease.

TI  - Kv4.3-Encoded Fast Transient Outward Current Is Presented in Kv4.2 Knockout Mouse 
      Cardiomyocytes.

AB  - Gradients of the fast transient outward K+ current (Ito,f) contribute to 
      heterogeneity of ventricular repolarization in a number of species. Cardiac Ito,f 
      levels and gradients change notably with heart disease. Human cardiac Ito,f appears 
      to be encoded by the Kv4.3 pore-forming α-subunit plus the auxiliary KChIP2 
      β-subunit while mouse cardiac Ito,f requires Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 α-subunits plus KChIP2. 
      Regional differences in cardiac Ito,f are associated with expression differences in 
      Kv4.2 and KChIP2. Although Ito,f was reported to be absent in mouse ventricular 
      cardiomyocytes lacking the Kv4.2 gene (Kv4.2-/-) when short depolarizing voltage 
      pulses were used to activate voltage-gated K+ currents, in the present study, we 
      showed that the use of long depolarization steps revealed a 
      heteropodatoxin-sensitive Ito,f (at ~40% of the wild-type levels). 
      Immunohistological studies further demonstrated membrane expression of Kv4.3 in 
      Kv4.2-/- cardiomyocytes. Transmural Ito,f gradients across the left ventricular wall 
      were reduced by ~3.5-fold in Kv4.2-/- heart, compared to wild-type. The Ito,f 
      gradient in Kv4.2-/- hearts was associated with gradients in KChIP2 mRNA expression 
      while in wild-type there was also a gradient in Kv4.2 expression. In conclusion, we 
      found that Kv4.3-based Ito,f exists in the absence of Kv4.2, although with a reduced 
      transmural gradient. Kv4.2-/- mice may be a useful animal model for studying 
      Kv4.3-based Ito,f as observed in humans.

TI  - Functional Maturation of GABA Synapses During Postnatal Development of the Monkey 
      Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex.
PG  - 4076-93
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhu122 [doi]
AB  - Development of inhibition onto pyramidal cells may be crucial for the emergence of 
      cortical network activity, including gamma oscillations. In primate dorsolateral 
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), inhibitory synaptogenesis starts in utero and inhibitory 
      synapse density reaches adult levels before birth. However, in DLPFC, the expression 
      levels of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synapse-related gene products changes markedly 
      during development until young adult age, suggesting a highly protracted maturation 
      of GABA synapse function. Therefore, we examined the development of GABA synapses by 
      recording GABAAR-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (GABAAR-IPSCs) from 
      pyramidal cells in the DLPFC of neonatal, prepubertal, peripubertal, and adult 
      macaque monkeys. We found that the decay of GABAAR-IPSCs, possibly including those 
      from parvalbumin-positive GABA neurons, shortened by prepubertal age, while their 
      amplitude increased until the peripubertal period. Interestingly, both 
      GABAAR-mediated quantal response size, estimated by miniature GABAAR-IPSCs, and the 
      density of GABAAR synaptic appositions, measured with immunofluorescence microscopy, 
      were stable with age. Simulations in a computational model network with constant 
      GABA synapse density showed that the developmental changes in GABAAR-IPSC properties 
      had a significant impact on oscillatory activity and predicted that, whereas DLPFC 
      circuits can generate gamma frequency oscillations by prepubertal age, mature levels 
      of gamma band power are attained at late stages of development.

TI  - Detection of marine toxins, brevetoxin-3 and saxitoxin, in seawater using neuronal 
      networks.
PG  - 578-83
AB  - There is a need for assay systems that can detect known and unanticipated 
      neurotoxins associated with harmful algal blooms. The present work describes our 
      attempt to monitor the presence of brevetoxin-3 (PbTx-3) and saxitoxin (STX) in a 
      seawater matrix using the neuronal network biosensor (NNB). The NNB relies on 
      cultured mammalian neurons grown over microelectrode arrays, where the inherent 
      bioelectrical activity of the network manifested as extracellular action potentials 
      can be monitored noninvasively. Spinal cord neuronal networks were prepared from 
      embryonic mice and the mean spike rate across the network was analyzed before and 
      during exposure to the toxins. Extracellular action potentials from the network are 
      highly sensitive not only to purified STX and PbTx-3, but also when in combination 
      with matrixes such as natural seawater and algal growth medium. Detection limits for 
      STX and PbTx-3, respectively, are 0.031 and 0.33 nM in recording buffer and 0.076 
      and 0.48 nM in the presence of 25-fold-diluted seawater. Our results demonstrated 
      that neuronal networks could be used for analysis of Alexandrium fundyense 
      (STX-producer) and Karenia brevis (PbTx-producer) algal samples lysed directly in 
      the seawater-based growth medium and appropriately diluted with HEPES-buffered 
      recording medium. The cultured network responded by changes in mean spike rate to 
      the presence of STX-or PbTx-producing algae but not to the samples of two non-STX 
      and non-PbTx isolates of the same algal genera. This work provides evidence that the 
      NNB has the capacity to rapidly detect toxins associated with cells of toxic algal 
      species or as dissolved forms present in seawater and hasthe potential for 
      monitoring toxin levels during harmful algal blooms.

TI  - Reduction in endocannabinoid tone is a homeostatic mechanism for specific inhibitory 
      synapses.
PG  - 592-600
LID - 10.1038/nn.2517 [doi]
AB  - When chronic alterations in neuronal activity occur, network gain is maintained by 
      global homeostatic scaling of synaptic strength, but the stability of microcircuits 
      can be controlled by unique adaptations that differ from the global changes. It is 
      not understood how specificity of synaptic tuning is achieved. We found that, 
      although a large population of inhibitory synapses was homeostatically scaled down 
      after chronic inactivity, decreased endocannabinoid tone specifically strengthened a 
      subset of GABAergic synapses that express cannabinoid receptors. In rat hippocampal 
      slice cultures, a 3-5-d blockade of neuronal firing facilitated uptake and 
      degradation of anandamide. The consequent reduction in basal stimulation of 
      cannabinoid receptors augmented GABA release probability, fostering rapid depression 
      of synaptic inhibition and on-demand disinhibition. This regulatory mechanism, 
      mediated by activity-dependent changes in tonic endocannabinoid level, permits 
      selective local tuning of inhibitory synapses in hippocampal networks.

AB  - Presynaptic functions of the mammalian central neurons are regulated by a network of 
      protein interactions. Synaptic vesicle recycling in and neurotransmitter release 
      from the presynaptic nerve terminals are altered when a glutamate-deleting mutation 
      is present in the torsinA protein (ΔE-torsinA). This mutation is linked with a 
      hereditary form of the movement disorder dystonia known as DYT1 dystonia. Although 
      torsinA expression is prevalent throughout the central nervous system, its 
      subcellular localization - in particular with respect to presynaptic nerve terminals 
      - remains unclear. This information would be useful in narrowing down possible 
      models for how wild-type torsinA affects presynaptic function, as well as the nature 
      of the presynaptic dysfunction that arises in the context of ΔE-torsinA mutation. 
      Here we report on an analysis of the presynaptic localization of torsinA in cultured 
      neurons obtained from a knock-in mouse model of DYT1 dystonia. Primary cultures of 
      neurons were established from heterozygous and homozygous ΔE-torsinA knock-in mice, 
      as well as from their wild-type littermates. Neurons were obtained from the 
      striatum, cerebral cortex and hippocampus of these mice, and were subjected to 
      immunocytochemistry. This analysis revealed the expression of both proteins in the 
      somata and dendrites. However, neither the nerve terminals nor axonal shafts were 
      immunoreactive. These results were confirmed by fluorogram-based quantitation. Our 
      findings indicate that neither the wild-type nor the ΔE-torsinA mutant protein is 
      present at substantial levels in the presynaptic structures of cultured neurons. 
      Thus, the effects of torsinA, in wild-type and mutant forms, appear to influence 
      presynaptic function indirectly, without residing in presynaptic structures.

AB  - Drugs are designed for therapy, but medication-related adverse events are common, 
      and risk/benefit analysis is critical for determining clinical use. Rosiglitazone, 
      an efficacious antidiabetic drug, is associated with increased myocardial 
      infarctions (MIs), thus limiting its usage. Because diabetic patients are often 
      prescribed multiple drugs, we searched for usage of a second drug ("drug B") in the 
      Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) that could 
      mitigate the risk of rosiglitazone ("drug A")-associated MI. In FAERS, rosiglitazone 
      usage is associated with increased occurrence of MI, but its combination with 
      exenatide significantly reduces rosiglitazone-associated MI. Clinical data from the 
      Mount Sinai Data Warehouse support the observations from FAERS. Analysis for 
      confounding factors using logistic regression showed that they were not responsible 
      for the observed effect. Using cell biological networks, we predicted that the 
      mitigating effect of exenatide on rosiglitazone-associated MI could occur through 
      clotting regulation. Data we obtained from the db/db mouse model agreed with the 
      network prediction. To determine whether polypharmacology could generally be a basis 
      for adverse event mitigation, we analyzed the FAERS database for other drug 
      combinations wherein drug B reduced serious adverse events reported with drug A 
      usage such as anaphylactic shock and suicidality. This analysis revealed 19,133 
      combinations that could be further studied. We conclude that this type of 
      crowdsourced approach of using databases like FAERS can help to identify drugs that 
      could potentially be repurposed for mitigation of serious adverse events.

AB  - Accurate risk assessment for drug-induced seizure is expected to be performed before 
      entering clinical studies because of its severity and fatal damage to drug 
      development. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology has allowed the use of 
      human neurons and glial cells in toxicology studies. Recently, several studies 
      showed the advantage of co-culture system of human iPSC (hiPSC)-derived neurons with 
      rodent/human primary astrocytes regarding neuronal functions. However, the 
      application of hiPSC-derived neurons for seizure risk assessment has not yet been 
      fully addressed, and not at all when co-cultured with hiPSC-derived astrocytes. 
      Here, we characterized hiPSC-derived neurons co-cultured with hiPSC-derived 
      astrocytes to discuss how hiPSC-derived neurons are useful to assess seizure risk of 
      drugs. First, we detected the frequency of spikes and synchronized bursts 
      hiPSC-derived neurons when co-cultured with hiPSC-derived astrocytes for 8 weeks. 
      This synchronized burst was suppressed by the treatment with 
      6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, 
      α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist, and 
      D-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid, an N-Methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor 
      antagonist. These data suggested that co-cultured hiPSC-derived neurons formed 
      synaptic connections mediated by AMPA and NMDA receptors. We also demonstrated that 
      co-cultured hiPSC-derived neurons showed epileptiform activity upon treatment with 
      gabazine or kaliotoxin. Finally, we performed single-cell transcriptome analysis in 
      hiPSC-derived neurons and found that hiPSC-derived astrocytes activated the pathways 
      involved in the activities of AMPA and NMDA receptor functions, neuronal polarity, 
      and axon guidance in hiPSC-derived neurons. These data suggested that hiPSC-derived 
      astrocytes promoted the development of action potential, synaptic functions, and 
      neuronal networks in hiPSC-derived neurons, and then these functional alterations 
      result in the epileptiform activity in response to convulsant drugs. Our study 
      indicates the possibility that co-culture system of hiPSC-derived neurons with 
      hiPSC-derived astrocytes could be useful in the risk assessment of drug-induced 
      seizure.

LID - 10.1038/psp.2013.67 [doi]
AB  - Bridging systems biology and pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics has resulted in 
      models that are highly complex and complicated. They usually contain large numbers 
      of states and parameters and describe multiple input-output relationships. Based on 
      any given data set relating to a specific input-output process, it is possible that 
      some states of the system are either less important or have no influence at all. In 
      this study, we explore a simplification of a systems pharmacology model of the 
      coagulation network for use in describing the time course of fibrinogen recovery 
      after a brown snake bite. The technique of proper lumping is used to simplify the 
      62-state systems model to a 5-state model that describes the brown snake 
      venom-fibrinogen relationship while maintaining an appropriate mechanistic 
      relationship. The simplified 5-state model explains the observed decline and 
      recovery in fibrinogen concentrations well. The techniques used in this study can be 
      applied to other multiscale models.

TI  - Presynaptic calcium channel inhibition underlies CB₁ cannabinoid receptor-mediated 
      suppression of GABA release.
PG  - 7958-63
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0247-14.2014 [doi]
AB  - CB1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1) are located at axon terminals and effectively 
      control synaptic communication and thereby circuit operation widespread in the CNS. 
      Although it is partially uncovered how CB1 activation leads to the reduction of 
      synaptic excitation, the mechanisms of the decrease of GABA release upon activation 
      of these cannabinoid receptors remain elusive. To determine the mechanisms 
      underlying the suppression of synaptic transmission by CB1 at GABAergic synapses, we 
      recorded unitary IPSCs (uIPSCs) at cholecystokinin-expressing interneuron-pyramidal 
      cell connections and imaged presynaptic [Ca(2+)] transients in mouse hippocampal 
      slices. Our results reveal a power function with an exponent of 2.2 between the 
      amplitude of uIPSCs and intrabouton [Ca(2+)]. Altering CB1 function by either 
      increasing endocannabinoid production or removing its tonic activity allowed us to 
      demonstrate that CB1 controls GABA release by inhibiting Ca(2+) entry into 
      presynaptic axon terminals via N-type (Cav2.2) Ca(2+) channels. These results 
      provide evidence for modulation of intrabouton Ca(2+) influx into GABAergic axon 
      terminals by CB1, leading to the effective suppression of synaptic inhibition.

TI  - Balance of calcineurin Aα and CDK5 activities sets release probability at nerve 
      terminals.
PG  - 8937-50
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4288-12.2013 [doi]
AB  - The control of neurotransmitter release at nerve terminals is of profound importance 
      for neurological function and provides a powerful control system in neural networks. 
      We show that the balance of enzymatic activities of the α isoform of the phosphatase 
      calcineurin (CNAα) and the kinase cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) has a dramatic 
      influence over single action potential (AP)-driven exocytosis at nerve terminals. 
      Acute or chronic loss of these enzymatic activities results in a sevenfold impact on 
      single AP-driven exocytosis. We demonstrate that this control is mediated almost 
      entirely through Cav2.2 (N-type) voltage-gated calcium channels as blocking these 
      channels with a peptide toxin eliminates modulation by these enzymes. We found that 
      a fraction of nerve terminals are kept in a presynaptically silent state with no 
      measurable Ca(2+) influx driven by single AP stimuli attributable to the balance of 
      CNAα and CDK5 activities because blockade of either CNAα or CDK5 activity changes 
      the proportion of presynaptically silent nerve terminals. Thus, CNAα and CDK5 
      enzymatic activities are key determinants of release probability.

AB  - Cinobufotalin (CB), one of the bufadienolides prepared from toad venom, was 
      investigated for its cytotoxicity, and the underneath mechanism involved. We 
      primarily utilized DNA fragmentation assay and microscopic observation to assess the 
      effect of various doses of CB in human lymphoma U937 cells. Following that, we 
      investigated other parameters involved in cell death mechanism such as reactive 
      oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and apoptotic proteins 
      activation. HeLa cells were concomitantly used to generalize the data observed. Our 
      results show that CB caused significant DNA fragmentation, decrease of MMP, and an 
      increase in the intracellular Ca(2+) ion and ROS production. In addition, CB induced 
      upregulation of Fas protein, proteolytic activation of cytochrome c, caspase-2, -3, 
      -8 and -9 together with the activation of Bid and Bax. Our findings were further 
      validated using either Fas/FasL antagonist or pan-caspase inhibitor to significantly 
      inhibit CB-induced DNA fragmentation. In our study, we suggest that CB induces 
      caspase dependent cell death in U937 cells, and that Fas plays a role in CB-induced 
      apoptosis. Altogether, our data provides novel insights of the mechanism of action 
      of CB and its potential as a future chemotherapeutic agent.

TI  - Quantitative analysis of fourteen bufadienolides in Venenum Bufonis crude drug and

      with tandem mass spectrometry.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Venenum Bufonis, a product of the secretions of Bufo 
      gargarizans Cantor or B. melanostictus Schneider, possessed an array of 
      pharmacological activities, such as cardiotonic, anti-tumor, antinociceptive, 
      anti-inflammatory, anesthetic and antimicrobial activities. However, there were few 
      efficient methods for quality evaluation of Venenum Bufonis medicinal materials and 
      its related Chinese patent medicines. AIM OF THE STUDY: To establish an effective 
      method for quality assessment of crude drugs and Chinese proprietary medicines of 
      Venenum Bufonis, and explore the relationship of primary compounds - target - 
      pathway - disease through a series of network databases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An 
      ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry 
      (UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS) method was developed and validated to simultaneously determine 14 
      bufadienolides for quantitative analysis of 71 batches of crude drugs and 20 kinds 
      of Chinese patent medicines of Venenum Bufonis. Multiple reaction monitoring with 
      good specificity and accuracy was applied to monitor the 14 bufadienolides in 
      positive mode. RESULTS: The methodology was validated with good specificity, 
      precision, stability, repeatability and recovery. The low limits of quantification 
      were in the range of 0.1-2.7 ng/mL. The relative standard deviation values for 
      intra- and inter-day precisions ranged from 0.98% to 6.3% and from 2.39% to 6.76%, 
      respectively. The recovery was varied from 87.78% to 110.57% for crude drugs and 
      88.32%-100.96% for Chinese proprietary medicine (Shexiang Baoxin Pill). The contents 
      of 14 analytes in 71 batches of crude drugs and 20 sorts of Chinese proprietary 
      medicines were procured, the results showed that the contents of crude drugs 
      collected from the market exhibited great variations. Furthermore, 13 batches of 
      crude drugs were identified as counterfeit with no bufadienolides detected. In 
      addition, the total contents of bufadienolides in the same drug showed great 
      difference among products from various manufacturers or brands. Subsequently, 9 
      bufadienolides with the higher contents were applied to screen the anti-tumor effect 
      by network pharmacology, and 8 pathways which had prior correlation with 
      bufadienolides were disclosed. CONCLUSION: This method could be used for quality 
      assessment of crude drugs and Chinese patent medicines of Venenum Bufonis, and the 
      data could be served as the fundamental basis for drug research and development of 
      Venenum Bufonis.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a stem cell-based disease. PIK3CA/KRAS-mutant CRC stem 
      cells (CRCSCs) display high self-renewal, metastatic properties, high activity of 
      PI3K and KRAS signaling pathways with chemoresistant phenotypes. Recently, RGD 
      peptide (containing Arg-Gly-Asp motif)-based therapy of solid tumor cells has 
      attracted much attention. However, little is known whether this method can target 
      self-renewal capacity, key effectors of PI3K and KRAS signaling pathways such as 
      metastasis-driver gene CXCR4 and stem cell regulatory genes with caspase-3 
      reactivation in CRCSCs overexpressing RGD-dependent integrins. The sea anemone 
      Actinia fragacea produces a water-soluble RGD-peptide fragacea toxin C (FraC) 
      suggesting the possible activity of FraC against PIK3CA/KRAS-mutant CRCSCs. 
      Recombinant FraC was expressed via pET-28a(+)-FraC in E. coli and purified through 
      affinity chromatography followed by performing SDS-PAGE and hemolytic activity 
      assay. Next, PIK3CA/KRAS-mutant HCT-116 cells that serve as an attractive model for 
      CRCSCs were treated with FraC. Thereafter, cell numbers, viability, proliferation, 
      LDH activity, cytotoxicity index, CXCR4 and pluripotency network genes expression, 
      self-renewal capacity, caspase-3 activity with apoptosis were evaluated. Caspase-1, 
      -2, -3,…, -9 sequences were analyzed for RGD-binding motifs. FraC sequence and 
      structure were also evaluated by bioinformatics software. FraC altered cellular 
      morphology to round shapes and disrupted cell connections. 48 h post-treatment with 
      0.056- to 7.2 μM FraC resulted in 12 %-99 % and 8 %-97.6 % decreases in cell numbers 
      and viabilities respectively and increased LDH activity by 0.2 %-66.7 % in a 
      dose-dependent manner. The results of the cytotoxicity index showed that FraC 
      induces significant toxicity on HCT-116 cells compared to PBMCs and Huvec cells. 
      FraC dramatically decreased the expression of CXCR4 and pluripotency network genes 
      Bmi-1, Sox-2, Oct-4 and Nanog followed by remarkable decreases in self-renewal 
      capacity ranged from 91- to 0 colonies per well for 0.056- to 3.6 μM FraC after 2 
      weeks. Caspase-3 was found to contain an RGD-binding motif and its activity 
      increased with increasing FraC concentrations followed by apoptosis induction. 
      Potential RGD-binding motifs for FraC were also found in caspase-1, -7, -8 and -9. 
      Unique advantages of FraC peptide, such as low molecular weight, water solubility, 
      high sensitivity of CRC stem-like cells with more selective toxicity to this 
      compound, targeting tumor cell membrane and self-renewal capacity along with the 
      modulation of CXCR4 and stem cell regulatory genes as upstream and downstream 
      effectors of undruggable PI3K and KRAS signaling pathways may open up avenues for 
      FraC peptide-based therapy of PIK3CA/KRAS-mutant CRCSCs with lower toxicity on 
      healthy cells.

TI  - Trimeric G proteins control exocytosis in chromaffin cells. Go regulates the 
      peripheral actin network and catecholamine secretion by a mechanism involving the 
      small GTP-binding protein Rho.
PG  - 20564-71
AB  - Besides having a role in signal transduction, heterotrimeric G proteins may be 
      involved in membrane trafficking events. In chromaffin cells, Go is associated with 
      secretory organelles and its activation by mastoparan inhibits the ATP-dependent 
      priming of exocytosis. The effectors by which Go controls exocytosis are currently 
      unknown. The subplasmalemmal actin network is one candidate, since it modulates 
      secretion by controlling the movement of secretory granules to the plasma membrane. 
      In streptolysin-O-permeabilized chromaffin cells, activation of exocytosis produces 
      disassembly of cortical actin filaments. Mastoparan blocks the calcium-evoked 
      disruption of cortical actin, and this effect is specifically inhibited by 
      antibodies against Galphao and by a synthetic peptide corresponding to the 
      COOH-terminal domain of Galphao. Disruption of actin filaments with cytochalasin E 
      and Clostridium perfringens iota toxin partially reverses the mastoparan-induced 
      inhibition of secretion. Furthermore, the effects of mastoparan on cortical actin 
      and exocytosis are greatly reduced in cells treated with Clostridium botulinum C3 
      exoenzyme, which specifically inactivates the small G protein Rho. We propose that 
      the control exerted by the granule-associated Go on exocytosis may be related to 
      effects on the cortical actin network through a sequence of events which eventually 
      involves the participation of Rho.

TI  - Regulation of Sticholysin II-Induced Pore Formation by Lipid Bilayer Composition, 
      Phase State, and Interfacial Properties.
PG  - 3476-84
LID - 10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b00082 [doi]
AB  - Sticholysin II (StnII) is a pore-forming toxin that uses sphingomyelin (SM) as the 
      recognition molecule in targeting membranes. After StnII monomers bind to SM, 
      several toxin monomers act in concert to oligomerize into a functional pore. The 
      regulation of StnII binding to SM, and the subsequent pore-formation process, is not 
      fully understood. In this study, we examined how the biophysical properties of 
      bilayers, originating from variations in the SM structure, from the presence of 
      sterol species, or from the presence of increasingly polyunsaturated 
      glycerophospholipids, affected StnII-induced pore formation. StnII-induced pore 
      formation, as determined from calcein permeabilization, was fastest in the pure 
      unsaturated SM bilayers. In 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine 
      (POPC)/saturated SM bilayers (4:1 molar ratio), pore formation became slower as the 
      chain length of the saturated SMs increased from 14 up to 24 carbons. In the 
      POPC/palmitoyl-SM (16:0-SM) 4:1 bilayers, SM could not support pore formation by 
      StnII if dimyristoyl-PC was included at 1:1 stoichiometry with 16:0-SM, suggesting 
      that free clusters of SM were required for toxin binding and/or pore formation. 
      Cholesterol and other sterols facilitated StnII-induced pore formation markedly, but 
      the efficiency did not appear to correlate with the sterol structure. Benzyl alcohol 
      was more efficient than sterols in enhancing the pore-formation process, suggesting 
      that the effect on pore formation originated from alcohol-induced alteration of the 
      hydrogen-bonding network in the SM-containing bilayers. Finally, we observed that 
      pore formation by StnII was enhanced in the PC/16:0-SM 4:1 bilayers, in which the PC 
      was increasingly unsaturated. We conclude that the physical state of bilayer lipids 
      greatly affected pore formation by StnII. Phase boundaries were not required for 
      pore formation, although SM in a gel state attenuated pore formation.

TI  - Role of phospholipase A2 pathway in regulating activation of Bufo arenarum oocytes.
PG  - 214-20
LID - 10.1017/S0967199411000645 [doi]
AB  - Transient increases in the concentration of cytosolic Ca(2+) are essential for 
      triggering egg activation events. Increased Ca(2+) results from its rapid release 
      from intracellular stores, mainly mediated by one or both intracellular calcium 
      channels: the inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) and the ryanodine receptor 
      (RyR). Several regulatory pathways that tailor the response of these channels to the 
      specific cell type have been proposed. Among its many modulatory actions, calcium 
      can serve as an activator of a cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA2), which releases 
      arachidonic acid from phospholipids of the endoplasmic reticulum as well as from the 
      nuclear envelope. Previous studies have suggested that arachidonic acid and/or its 
      metabolites were able to modulate the activity of several ion channels. Based on 
      these findings, we have studied the participation of the phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) 
      pathway in the process of Bufo arenarum oocyte activation and the interrelation 
      between any of its metabolites and the ion channels involved in the calcium release 
      from the intracellular reservoirs at fertilization. We found that addition of both 
      melittin, a potent PLA(2) activator, and arachidonic acid, the main PLA(2) reaction 
      metabolite, was able to induce activation events in a bell-shaped manner. 
      Differential regulation of IP3Rs and RyRs by arachidonic acid and its products could 
      explain melittin and arachidonic acid behaviour in Bufo arenarum egg activation. The 
      concerted action of arachidonic acid and/or its metabolites could provide controlled 
      mobilization of calcium from intracellular reservoirs and useful tools for 
      understanding calcium homeostasis in eggs that express both types of receptors.

TI  - Crystal structure analysis of phospholipase A2 from trimeresurus flavoviridis (Habu 
      snake) venom at 1.5 A resolution.
PG  - 730-40
AB  - The crystal structure of dimeric phospholipase A2 (PLA2) from the venom of Habu 
      snake, Trimeresurus flavoviridis, has been determined by the molecular replacement 
      method, and has been refined at 1.5 A resolution to an R-factor of 0.175. In the 
      crystal, T. flavoviridis PLA2 forms a dimer using two 14 kDa subunits related by a 
      pseudo 2-fold axis. Along the axis, the dimer has a narrow channel passing through 
      it. Although no calcium ion is present in the calcium binding site, the 
      peptide-chain folding of the subunits, the conformation of the catalytic residues, 
      and the hydrogen-bonding network around the active sites are almost identical to 
      those of the group I/II monomeric or dimeric PLA2s. The catalytic residues in both 
      subunits are buried in the interior of the dimer and are inaccessible to substrate 
      from the bulk solvent. In addition, the subunits of the dimer interact with each 
      other at the hydrophobic region of the molecular surface where the entrance to the 
      active site opens and where PLA2 is presumed to interact with the phospholipid of 
      the substrate. Therefore, it is inferred that dimerization of T. flavoviridis PLA2 
      is the result of free-energy minimization by excluding the hydrophobic molecular 
      surface from the aqueous solvent, rather than being required for the enzymatic 
      function.

TI  - Pairwise agonist scanning predicts cellular signaling responses to combinatorial 
      stimuli.

AB  - Prediction of cellular response to multiple stimuli is central to evaluating 
      patient-specific clinical status and to basic understanding of cell biology. 
      Cross-talk between signaling pathways cannot be predicted by studying them in 
      isolation and the combinatorial complexity of multiple agonists acting together 
      prohibits an exhaustive exploration of the complete experimental space. Here we 
      describe pairwise agonist scanning (PAS), a strategy that trains a neural network 
      model based on measurements of cellular responses to individual and all pairwise 
      combinations of input signals. We apply PAS to predict calcium signaling responses 
      of human platelets in EDTA-treated plasma to six different agonists (ADP, convulxin, 
      U46619, SFLLRN, AYPGKF and PGE(2)) at three concentrations (0.1, 1 and 10 x EC(50)). 
      The model predicted responses to sequentially added agonists, to ternary 
      combinations of agonists and to 45 different combinations of four to six agonists (R 
      = 0.88). Furthermore, we use PAS to distinguish between the phenotypic responses of 
      platelets from ten donors. Training neural networks with pairs of stimuli across the 
      dose-response regime represents an efficient approach for predicting complex signal 
      integration in a patient-specific disease milieu.

TI  - iCTX-type: a sequence-based predictor for identifying the types of conotoxins in 
      targeting ion channels.

AB  - Conotoxins are small disulfide-rich neurotoxic peptides, which can bind to ion 
      channels with very high specificity and modulate their activities. Over the last few 
      decades, conotoxins have been the drug candidates for treating chronic pain, 
      epilepsy, spasticity, and cardiovascular diseases. According to their functions and 
      targets, conotoxins are generally categorized into three types: potassium-channel 
      type, sodium-channel type, and calcium-channel types. With the avalanche of peptide 
      sequences generated in the postgenomic age, it is urgent and challenging to develop 
      an automated method for rapidly and accurately identifying the types of conotoxins 
      based on their sequence information alone. To address this challenge, a new 
      predictor, called iCTX-Type, was developed by incorporating the dipeptide occurrence 
      frequencies of a conotoxin sequence into a 400-D (dimensional) general pseudoamino 
      acid composition, followed by the feature optimization procedure to reduce the 
      sample representation from 400-D to 50-D vector. The overall success rate achieved 
      by iCTX-Type via a rigorous cross-validation was over 91%, outperforming its 
      counterpart (RBF network). Besides, iCTX-Type is so far the only predictor in this 
      area with its web-server available, and hence is particularly useful for most 
      experimental scientists to get their desired results without the need to follow the 
      complicated mathematics involved.

TI  - Amino acid sequence of a myotoxic Lys49-phospholipase A2 homologue from the venom of 
      Cerrophidion (Bothrops) godmani.
PG  - 204-8
AB  - The complete amino acid sequence of myotoxin II (godMT-II), a myotoxic phospholipase 
      A2 (PLA2) homologue from the venom of the Central American crotaline snake 
      Cerrophidion (Bothrops) godmani, was determined by direct protein sequencing 
      methods. GodMT-II is a class II PLA2 showing a Lys instead of Asp at position 49. An 
      additional substitution in the calcium binding loop region (Asn instead of Tyr at 
      position 28) suggests the lack of enzymatic activity observed in this toxin is due 
      to loss of its ability to bind the co-factor Ca2+, since the residues involved in 
      forming the catalytic network of PLA2s (His-48, Tyr-52 and Asp-99) are conserved in 
      godMT-II. This myotoxin shows highest sequence homology with other Lys-49 PLA2 s 
      from Bothrops, Agkistrodon and Trimeresurus species, suggesting that they constitute 
      a conserved family of proteins, yet in contrast presents lower homology with 
      Bothrops asper myotoxin III, a catalytically-active PLA2. The C-terminal region of 
      godMT-II, which is rich in cationic and hydrophobic residues, shares high sequence 
      homology to the corresponding region in the myotoxin II from B. asper, which has 
      been proposed to play an important role in the Ca(2+)-independent membrane damaging 
      activity.

TI  - Antidiabetic exendin-4 activates apoptotic pathway and inhibits growth of breast 
      cancer cells.

AB  - Exendin-4 is a GLP-1 analog used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in 
      its synthetic form. As women with diabetes have higher breast cancer incidence and 
      mortality, we examined the effect of the incretin drug exendin-4 on breast cancer 
      cells. The aim of the study is to investigate anticancer mechanism of exendin-4 in 
      MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Cytotoxic effects of exendin-4 were determined by XTT 
      assay. IC50 dose in MCF-7 cells were detected as 5 μM at 48th hour. Gene messenger 
      RNA (mRNA) expressions were evaluated by real-time PCR. According to results, 
      caspase-9, Akt, and MMP2 expression was reduced in dose group cells, compared with 
      the control group cells. p53, caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-10, BID, DR4, DR5, FADD, 
      TRADD, PARP, PTEN, PUMA, NOXA, APAF, TIMP1, and TIMP2 expression was increased in 
      dose group cells, compared with the control group cells. Effects of exendin-4 on 
      cell invasion, colony formation, and cell migration were detected by Matrigel 
      chamber, colony formation assay, and wound-healing assay, respectively. To conclude, 
      it is thought that exendin-4 demonstrates anticarcinogenesis activity by effecting 
      apoptosis, invasion, migration, and colony formation in MCF-7 cells. Exendin-4 may 
      be a therapeutic agent for treatment of breast cancer as single or in combination 
      with other agents. More detailed researches are required to define the pathways of 
      GLP-1 effect on breast cancer cells because of the molecular biology of breast 
      cancer that involves a complex network of interconnected signaling pathways that 
      have role in cell growth, survival, and cell invasion.

TI  - The rheological properties of beta amyloid Langmuir monolayers: Comparative studies 
      with melittin peptide.

AB  - We determined the rheological properties of β-amyloid Langmuir films at the 
      air/water interface, a peptide whose interfacial structure is extended β-sheet, and 
      compared them with those of films composed of Melittin (Mel), which adopts an 
      α-helical conformation at neutral pH. To determine the dilatational and shear moduli 
      we evaluated the response of pure peptide monolayers to an oscillatory anisotropic 
      compressive work. Additionally, a micro-rheological characterization was performed 
      by tracking the diffusion of micrometer sized latex beads onto the interface. This 
      technique allowed us the detection of different rheological behaviour between 
      monolayers presenting a low shear response. Monolayers of the β-sheet 
      structure-adopting peptides, such as β-amyloid peptides, exhibited a marked shear 
      (elastic) modulus even at low surface pressures. In contrast, Mel monolayers 
      exhibited negligible shear modulus and the micro-rheological shear response was 
      markedly lower than that observed for either Aβ1-40 or Aβ1-42 amyloid peptides. When 
      Mel monolayers were formed at the interface of an aqueous solution at pH 11, we 
      observed an increase in both the lateral stability and film viscosity as detected by 
      a slower diffusion of the latex beads, in keeping with an increase in β-sheet 
      structure at this high pH (verified by ATR and FT-IR measurements). We suggest that 
      the interactions responsible for the marked response upon shear observed for 
      β-amyloid peptide monolayers are the hydrogen bonds of the β-sheet structure that 
      can form an infinite planar network at the interface. Conversely, α-helical Mel 
      peptide lack of these inter-molecular interactions and, therefore the shear 
      contribution was negligible. We propose that the secondary structure is important 
      for modulating the rheological behavior of short peptide monolayers regardless of 
      the mass density or surface charge at the surface.

TI  - Effect of cobratoxin binding on the normal mode vibration within acetylcholine 
      binding protein.
PG  - 855-60
LID - 10.1021/ci700456s [doi]
AB  - Recent crystal structures of the acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP) have revealed 
      surprisingly small structural alterations upon ligand binding. Here we investigate 
      the extent to which ligand binding may affect receptor dynamics. AChBP is a 
      homologue of the extracellular component of ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs). We 
      have previously used an elastic network normal-mode analysis to propose a gating 
      mechanism for the LGICs and to suggest the effects of various ligands on such 
      motions. However, the difficulties with elastic network methods lie in their 
      inability to account for the modest effects of a small ligand or mutation on ion 
      channel motion. Here, we report the successful application of an elastic network 
      normal mode technique to measure the effects of large ligand binding on receptor 
      dynamics. The present calculations demonstrate a clear alteration in the native 
      symmetric motions of a protein due to the presence of large protein cobratoxin 
      ligands. In particular, normal-mode analysis revealed that cobratoxin binding to 
      this protein significantly dampened the axially symmetric motion of the AChBP that 
      may be associated with channel gating in the full nAChR. The results suggest that 
      alterations in receptor dynamics could be a general feature of ligand binding.

TI  - β-pompilidotoxin modulates spontaneous activity and persistent sodium currents in 
      spinal networks.
PG  - 129-38
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2010.10.034 [doi]
AB  - The origin of rhythm generation in mammalian spinal cord networks is still poorly 
      understood. In a previous study, we showed that spontaneous activity in spinal 
      networks takes its origin in the properties of certain intrinsically spiking 
      interneurons based on the persistent sodium current (INaP). We also showed that 
      depolarization block caused by a fast inactivation of the transient sodium current 
      (INaT) contributes to the generation of oscillatory activity in spinal cord 
      cultures. Recently, a toxin called beta-pompilidotoxin (β-PMTX) that slows the 
      inactivation process of tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive sodium channels has been 
      extracted from the solitary wasp venom. In the present study, we therefore 
      investigated the effect of β-PMTX on rhythm generation and on sodium currents in 
      spinal networks. Using intracellular recordings and multielectrode array (MEA) 
      recordings in dissociated spinal cord cultures from embryonic (E14) rats, we found 
      that β-PMTX reduces the number of population bursts and increases the background 
      asynchronous activity. We then uncoupled the network by blocking all synaptic 
      transmission (APV, CNQX, bicuculline and strychnine) and observed that β-PMTX 
      increases both the intrinsic activity at individual channels and the number of 
      intrinsically activated channels. At the cellular level, we found that β-PMTX has 
      two effects: it switches 58% of the silent interneurons into spontaneously active 
      interneurons and increases the firing rate of intrinsically spiking cells. Finally, 
      we investigated the effect of β-PMTX on sodium currents. We found that this toxin 
      not only affects the inactivation of INaT but also increases the peak amplitude of 
      the persistent sodium current (INaP). Altogether, theses findings suggest that 
      β-PMTX acting on INaP and INaT enhances intrinsic activity leading to a profound 
      modulation of spontaneous rhythmic activity in spinal networks.

TI  - Ulk1-mediated autophagy plays an essential role in mitochondrial remodeling and 
      functional regeneration of skeletal muscle.
PG  - C724-C732
LID - 10.1152/ajpcell.00348.2016 [doi]
AB  - Autophagy is a conserved cellular process for degrading aggregate proteins and 
      dysfunctional organelle. It is still debatable if autophagy and mitophagy (a 
      specific process of autophagy of mitochondria) play important roles in myogenic 
      differentiation and functional regeneration of skeletal muscle. We tested the 
      hypothesis that autophagy is critical for functional regeneration of skeletal 
      muscle. We first observed time-dependent increases (3- to 6-fold) of 
      autophagy-related proteins (Atgs), including Ulk1, Beclin1, and LC3, along with 
      reduced p62 expression during C2C12 differentiation, suggesting increased autophagy 
      capacity and flux during myogenic differentiation. We then used cardiotoxin (Ctx) or 
      ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) to induce muscle injury and regeneration and observed 
      increases in Atgs between days 2 and 7 in adult skeletal muscle followed by 
      increased autophagy flux after day 7 Since Ulk1 has been shown to be essential for 
      mitophagy, we asked if Ulk1 is critical for functional regeneration in skeletal 
      muscle. We subjected skeletal muscle-specific Ulk1 knockout mice (MKO) to Ctx or 
      I/R. MKO mice had significantly impaired recovery of muscle strength and 
      mitochondrial protein content post-Ctx or I/R. Imaging analysis showed that MKO mice 
      have significantly attenuated recovery of mitochondrial network at 7 and 14 days 
      post-Ctx. These findings suggest that increased autophagy protein and flux occur 
      during muscle regeneration and Ulk1-mediated mitophagy is critical for recovery for 
      the mitochondrial network and hence functional regeneration.

TI  - Effects of pancreatic duct ligation on pancreatic response to bombesin.
PG  - G633-9
AB  - To examine mechanisms that might be related to biliary pancreatitis, we examined the 
      effects of pancreatic duct ligation (PDL) with pancreatic stimulation in vivo. PDL 
      alone caused no increase in pancreatic levels of trypsinogen activation peptide 
      (TAP), trypsin, or chymotrypsin and did not initiate pancreatitis. Although bombesin 
      caused zymogen activation within the pancreas, the increases were slight and it did 
      not cause pancreatitis. However, the combination of PDL with bombesin resulted in 
      prominent increases in pancreatic TAP, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and the appearance of 
      TAP in acinar cells and caused pancreatitis. Disruption of the apical actin network 
      in the acinar cell was observed when PDL was combined with bombesin but not with PDL 
      or bombesin alone. These studies suggest that when PDL is combined with pancreatic 
      acinar cell stimulation, it can promote zymogen activation, the retention of active 
      enzymes in acinar cells, and the development of acute pancreatitis.

AB  - Activation of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) in pancreatic β-cells 
      potentiates insulin production and is a current therapeutic target for the treatment 
      of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Like other class B G protein-coupled receptors 
      (GPCRs), the GLP-1R contains an N-terminal extracellular ligand binding domain. 
      N-terminal truncations on the peptide agonist generate antagonists capable of 
      binding to the extracellular domain, but not capable of activating full length 
      receptor. The main objective of this study was to use Hydrogen/deuterium exchange 
      (HDX) to identify how the amide hydrogen bonding network of peptide ligands and the 
      extracellular domain of GLP-1R (nGLP-1R) were altered by binding interactions and to 
      then use this platform to validate direct binding events for putative GLP-1R small 
      molecule ligands. The HDX studies presented here for two glucagon-like peptide-1 
      receptor (GLP-1R) peptide ligands indicates that the antagonist exendin-4[9-39] is 
      significantly destabilized in the presence of nonionic detergents as compared to the 
      agonist exendin-4. Furthermore, HDX can detect stabilization of exendin-4 and 
      exendin-4[9-39] hydrogen bonding networks at the N-terminal helix [Val19 to Lys27] 
      upon binding to the N-terminal extracellular domain of GLP-1R (nGLP-1R). In addition 
      we show hydrogen bonding network stabilization on nGLP-1R in response to ligand 
      binding, and validate direct binding events with the extracellular domain of the 
      receptor for putative GLP-1R small molecule ligands.

AB  - Computational prediction of residues that participate in protein-protein 
      interactions is a difficult task, and state of the art methods have shown only 
      limited success in this arena. One possible problem with these methods is that they 
      try to predict interacting residues without incorporating information about the 
      partner protein, although it is unclear how much partner information could enhance 
      prediction performance. To address this issue, the two following comparisons are of 
      crucial significance: (a) comparison between the predictability of inter-protein 
      residue pairs, i.e., predicting exactly which residue pairs interact with each other 
      given two protein sequences; this can be achieved by either combining conventional 
      single-protein predictions or making predictions using a new model trained directly 
      on the residue pairs, and the performance of these two approaches may be compared: 
      (b) comparison between the predictability of the interacting residues in a single 
      protein (irrespective of the partner residue or protein) from conventional methods 
      and predictions converted from the pair-wise trained model. Using these two streams 
      of training and validation procedures and employing similar two-stage neural 
      networks, we showed that the models trained on pair-wise contacts outperformed the 
      partner-unaware models in predicting both interacting pairs and interacting 
      single-protein residues. Prediction performance decreased with the size of the 
      conformational change upon complex formation; this trend is similar to docking, even 
      though no structural information was used in our prediction. An example application 
      that predicts two partner-specific interfaces of a protein was shown to be 
      effective, highlighting the potential of the proposed approach. Finally, a 
      preliminary attempt was made to score docking decoy poses using prediction of 
      interacting residue pairs; this analysis produced an encouraging result.

AB  - The ability to yield glucose-responsive pancreatic beta-cells from human pluripotent 
      stem cells in vitro will facilitate the development of the cell replacement 
      therapies for the treatment of Type 1 Diabetes. Here, through the sequential in 
      vitro targeting of selected signaling pathways, we have developed an abbreviated 
      five-stage protocol (25-30 days) to generate human Embryonic Stem Cell-Derived 
      Beta-like Cells (ES-DBCs). We showed that Geltrex, as an extracellular matrix, could 
      support the generation of ES-DBCs more efficiently than that of the previously 
      described culture systems. The activation of FGF and Retinoic Acid along with the 
      inhibition of BMP, SHH and TGF-beta led to the generation of 75% NKX6.1+/NGN3+ 
      Endocrine Progenitors. The inhibition of Notch and tyrosine kinase receptor AXL, and 
      the treatment with Exendin-4 and T3 in the final stage resulted in 35% mono-hormonal 
      insulin positive cells, 1% insulin and glucagon positive cells and 30% insulin and 
      NKX6.1 co-expressing cells. Functionally, ES-DBCs were responsive to high glucose in 
      static incubation and perifusion studies, and could secrete insulin in response to 
      successive glucose stimulations. Mitochondrial metabolic flux analyses using 
      Seahorse demonstrated that the ES-DBCs could efficiently metabolize glucose and 
      generate intracellular signals to trigger insulin secretion. In conclusion, 
      targeting selected signaling pathways for 25-30 days was sufficient to generate 
      ES-DBCs in vitro. The ability of ES-DBCs to secrete insulin in response to glucose 
      renders them a promising model for the in vitro screening of drugs, small molecules 
      or genes that may have potential to influence beta-cell function.

TI  - Molecular modeling and structural analysis of nAChR variants uncovers the mechanism 
      of resistance to snake toxins.

AB  - Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are neuromuscular proteins responsible 
      for muscle contraction upon binding with chemical stimulant acetylcholine (ACh). The 
      α-neurotoxins of snake mimic the structure of ACh and attacks nAChRs, which block 
      the flow of ACh and leads to numbness and paralysis. The toxin-binding site of alpha 
      subunit in the nAChRs is highly conserved throughout chordate lineages with few 
      exceptions in resistance organisms. In this study, we have analyzed the sequence and 
      structures of toxin-binding/resistant nAChRs and their interaction stability with 
      toxins through molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation (MDS). We have 
      reported the potential glycosylation residues within the toxin-binding cleft adding 
      sugar moieties through N-linked glycosylation in resistant organisms. Residue 
      variations at key positions alter the secondary structure of binding cleft, which 
      might interfere with toxin binding and it could be one of the possible explanations 
      for the resistance to snake venoms. Analysis of nAChR-α-neurotoxin complexes has 
      confirmed the key interacting residues. In addition, drastic variation in the 
      binding stability of Mongoose nAChR-α-Bungarotoxin (α-BTX) and human nAChR-α-BTX 
      complexes were found at specific phase of MDS. Our findings suggest that specific 
      mutations in the binding site of toxin are potentially preventing the formation of 
      stable complex of receptor-toxin, which might lead to mechanism of resistance. This 
      in silico study on the binding cleft of nAChR and the findings of interacting 
      residues will assist in designing potential inhibitors as therapeutic targets.

TI  - Platelet-rich plasma and platelet gel preparation using Plateltex.
PG  - 202-8

AB  - BACKGROUND: The platelet gel is made by embedding concentrate platelets within a 
      semisolid (gel) network of polymerized fibrin. It is believed that this blood 
      component will be used more and more in the treatment of several clinical conditions 
      and as an adjunctive material in tissue engineering. Several systems are available 
      to produce platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for topical therapy. Recently, a new system 
      became commercially available, Plateltex. Here we report the technical performance 
      of this system in comparison with the performance of other commercially available 
      systems: PRGF, PRP-Landesber, Curasan, PCCS, Harvest, Vivostat, Regen and Fibrinet. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Both the PRP and the gel were prepared according to the 
      manufacturer's directions. The blood samples of 20 donors were used. The yield, the 
      efficiency, and the amount of platelet-derived growth factor AB (PDGF-AB), 
      transforming growth factor beta, vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast 
      growth factor were measured in the resulting PRP. The feature of the 
      batroxobin-induced gelation was evaluated. RESULTS: The yield, the collection 
      efficiency and the growth factor content of Plateltex were comparable to those of 
      most of the other available systems. The gelation time was not dependent on the 
      fibrinogen concentration; however, it was strongly influenced by the contact surface 
      area of the container where the clotting reaction took place (P < 0.0001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Plateltex provided platelet recovery, collection efficiency and PDGF-AB 
      availability close to those provided by other systems marketed with the same 
      intended use. Batroxobin, the enzyme provided to induce gelation, acts differently 
      from thrombin, which is used by most other systems. Platelets treated with thrombin 
      become activated; they release their growth factors quickly. Furthermore, 
      thrombin-platelet interaction is a physiological mechanism that hastens the 
      clot-retraction rate. On the contrary, platelets treated with batroxobin do not 
      become activated; they are passively entrapped within the fibrin network, and their 
      growth factor release occurs slowly. In these conditions, the clot retraction takes 
      longer to occur. According to these differences between thrombin and batroxobin, it 
      is expected that batroxobin-induced PRP activation will tailor slow release of the 
      platelet content, thus, providing longer in loco availability of trophic factors. In 
      selected clinical conditions, this durable anabolic factor availability might be 
      preferable to quick thrombin-induced growth factor release.

TI  - The transcription factor B-cell lymphoma (BCL)-6 modulates pancreatic {beta}-cell 
      inflammatory responses.
PG  - 447-56
LID - 10.1210/en.2010-0790 [doi]
AB  - Type 1 diabetes is a chronic autoimmune disease with a strong inflammatory 
      component. We have previously shown that expression of the transcriptional repressor 
      B-cell lymphoma (BCL)-6 is very low in pancreatic β-cells, which may favor prolonged 
      proinflammatory responses after exposure to the cytokines IL-1β and interferon γ. 
      Here we investigated whether cytokine-induced inflammation and apoptosis can be 
      prevented in β-cells by BCL-6 expression using plasmid, prolactin, and adenoviral 
      approaches. The induction of mild or abundant BCL-6 expression in β-cells by 
      prolactin or an adenoviral BCL-6 expression construct, respectively, reduced 
      cytokine-induced inflammatory responses in a dose-dependent manner through 
      inhibition of nuclear factor-κB activation. BCL-6 decreased Fas and inducible nitric 
      oxide synthase expression and nitric oxide production, but it inhibited the 
      expression of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and JunB while increasing the 
      expression of the proapoptotic death protein 5. The net result of these opposite 
      effects was an augmentation of β-cell apoptosis. In conclusion, BCL-6 expression 
      tones down the unrestrained cytokine-induced proinflammatory response of β-cells but 
      it also favors gene networks leading to apoptosis. This suggests that 
      cytokine-induced proinflammatory and proapoptotic signals can be dissociated in 
      β-cells. Further understanding of these pathways may open new possibilities to 
      improve β-cell survival in early type 1 diabetes or after transplantation.

TI  - Structure of conkunitzin-S1, a neurotoxin and Kunitz-fold disulfide variant from 
      cone snail.
PG  - 980-90
AB  - Cone snails (Conus) are predatory marine mollusks that immobilize prey with venom 
      containing 50-200 neurotoxic polypeptides. Most of these polypeptides are small 
      disulfide-rich conotoxins that can be classified into families according to their 
      respective ion-channel targets and patterns of cysteine-cysteine disulfides. 
      Conkunitzin-S1, a potassium-channel pore-blocking toxin isolated from C. striatus 
      venom, is a member of a newly defined conotoxin family with sequence homology to 
      Kunitz-fold proteins such as alpha-dendrotoxin and bovine pancreatic trypsin 
      inhibitor (BPTI). While conkunitzin-S1 and alpha-dendrotoxin are 42% identical in 
      amino-acid sequence, conkunitzin-S1 has only four of the six cysteines normally 
      found in Kunitz proteins. Here, the crystal structure of conkunitzin-S1 is reported. 
      Conkunitzin-S1 adopts the canonical 3(10)-beta-beta-alpha Kunitz fold complete with 
      additional distinguishing structural features including two completely buried water 
      molecules. The crystal structure, although completely consistent with previously 
      reported NMR distance restraints, provides a greater degree of precision for atomic 
      coordinates, especially for S atoms and buried solvent molecules. The region 
      normally cross-linked by cysteines II and IV in other Kunitz proteins retains a 
      network of hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions comparable to those found 
      in alpha-dendrotoxin and BPTI. In conkunitzin-S1, glycine occupies the sequence 
      position normally reserved for cysteine II and the special steric properties of 
      glycine allow additional van der Waals contacts with the glutamine residue 
      substituting for cysteine IV. Evolution has thus defrayed the cost of losing a 
      disulfide bond by augmenting and optimizing weaker yet nonetheless effective 
      non-covalent interactions.

AB  - Our team aimed to create a new, simple, and inexpensive technique for collecting and 
      transferring of toxic jellyfish specimens and for nematocysts identification. We 
      collected tentacles of Chironex spp., Morbakka spp., and Physalia spp., and 
      transferred them from the beaches by standard and by 'vacuum sticky tape' (VST) 
      techniques. For the VST technique, our team placed the sticky tape on a tentacle and 
      then folded it over to seal the tentacle in the equivalent of a vacuum. We kept the 
      VST in room temperature. For nematocyst identification, we placed the VST on a glass 
      microscope slide and took photographs down the microscope's eye piece using a mobile 
      phone camera. The image quality was as good as when produced by standard techniques. 
      Different classes of toxic jellyfish could be identified. Thus, VST is a potential 
      public health breakthrough because it is practical, durable, inexpensive, allows 
      good discrimination. It enables early warning of danger to health and rapid response 
      via social network.

TI  - Cost Effectiveness of Exenatide Once Weekly Versus Insulin Glargine and Liraglutide 
      for the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Greece.
PG  - 67-77
LID - 10.1007/s40261-017-0586-0 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term cost 
      effectiveness of exenatide once weekly (ExQW) versus insulin glargine (IG) or 
      liraglutide 1.2 mg (Lira1.2mg) for the treatment of adult patients with type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) not adequately controlled on oral antidiabetic drug (OAD) 
      therapy in Greece. METHODS: The published and validated Cardiff Diabetes Model was 
      used to project clinical and economic outcomes over a patient's lifetime. Clinical 
      data were retrieved from a head-to-head clinical trial (DURATION 3) and a published 
      network meta-analysis comparing ExQW with IG or Lira1.2mg, respectively. Following a 
      Greek third-party payer perspective, direct medical costs related to drug 
      acquisition, consumables, developed micro- and macrovascular complications, 
      maintenance treatment, as well as treatment-related adverse events were considered. 
      Cost and utility data were extracted from literature and publicly available official 
      sources and assigned to model parameters to calculate total quality-adjusted 
      life-years (QALYs) and total costs as well as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
      (ICERs). Sensitivity analyses explored the impact of changes in input data. RESULTS: 
      Over a patient's lifetime, ExQW was associated with 0.458 or 0.039 incremental QALYs 
      compared with IG or Lira1.2mg, respectively, at additional costs of €2061 or €110, 
      respectively. The ICER for ExQW was €4499/QALY compared with IG and €2827/QALY 
      compared with Lira1.2mg. Results were robust across various one-way and scenario 
      analyses. At the defined willingness-to-pay threshold of €36,000/QALY, probabilistic 
      sensitivity analysis showed that ExQW had a 100 or 88.2% probability of being cost 
      effective relative to IG or Lira1.2mg, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: ExQW was estimated 
      to be cost effective relative to IG or Lira1.2mg for the treatment of T2DM in adults 
      not adequately controlled on OAD therapy in Greece.

TI  - Cyclic AMP signaling stimulates proteasome degradation of thioredoxin interacting 
      protein (TxNIP) in pancreatic beta-cells.
PG  - 1240-6
LID - 10.1016/j.cellsig.2010.04.001 [doi]
AB  - Thioredoxin interacting protein (TxNIP) functions as an effector of glucotoxicity in 
      pancreatic beta-cells. Exendin-4 (Ex-4), a long-term effective GLP-1 receptor 
      agonist, reduces TxNIP level in pancreatic beta-cells. Mechanisms underlying this 
      reduction, however, remain largely unknown. We show here that Ex-4, 8-bromo-cAMP, 
      the cAMP promoting agent forskolin, as well as activators of protein kinase A (PKA) 
      and exchange protein activated by cAMP (Epac), all attenuated the effect of high 
      glucose (20mM) on TxNIP level in the pancreatic beta-cell line Ins-1. Forskolin and 
      Ex-4 also reduced TxNIP level in cultured primary rat islets. This repressive effect 
      is at least partially mediated via stimulating proteasome-dependent TxNIP 
      degradation, since the proteasomal inhibitor MG132, but not the lysosomal inhibitor 
      chloroquine, significantly blocked the repressive effect of forskolin. Furthermore, 
      forskolin enhanced TxNIP ubiquitination. Both PKA inhibition and Epac inhibition 
      partially blocked the repressive effect of forskolin on TxNIP level. In addition, 
      forskolin and Ex-4 protected Ins-1 cells from high glucose-induced apoptotic 
      activity, assessed by measuring caspase 3 activity. Finally, knockdown of TxNIP 
      expression led to reduced caspase 3 expression levels and blunted response to 
      forskolin treatment. We suggest that proteasome-dependent TxNIP degradation is a 
      novel mechanism by which Ex-4-cAMP signaling protects pancreatic beta cells.

AB  - Neuronal circuits depend on the precise regulation of cell-surface receptors and ion 
      channels. An ongoing challenge in neuroscience research is deciphering the 
      functional contribution of specific receptors and ion channels using engineered 
      modulators. A novel strategy, termed "tethered toxins", was recently developed to 
      characterize neuronal circuits using the evolutionary derived selectivity of venom 
      peptide toxins and endogenous peptide ligands, such as lynx1 prototoxins. Herein, 
      the discovery and engineering of cell-surface tethered peptides is reviewed, with 
      particular attention given to their cell-autonomy, modular composition, and genetic 
      targeting in different model organisms. The relative ease with which tethered 
      peptides can be engineered, coupled with the increasing number of neuroactive venom 
      toxins and ligand peptides being discovered, imply a multitude of potentially 
      innovative applications for manipulating neuronal circuits and tissue-specific cell 
      networks, including treatment of disorders caused by malfunction of receptors and 
      ion channels.

TI  - Sphingolipids are necessary for nicotinic acetylcholine receptor export in the early 
      secretory pathway.
PG  - 1072-84
AB  - The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) is the prototype ligand-gated ion 
      channel, and its function is dependent on its lipid environment. In order to study 
      the involvement of sphingolipids (SL) in AChR trafficking, we used pharmacological 
      approaches to dissect the SL biosynthetic pathway in CHO-K1/A5 cells heterologously 
      expressing the muscle-type AChR. When SL biosynthesis was impaired, the cell surface 
      targeting of AChR diminished with a concomitant increase in the intracellular 
      receptor pool. The SL-inhibiting drugs increased unassembled AChR forms, which were 
      retained at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These effects on AChR biogenesis and 
      trafficking could be reversed by the addition of exogenous SL, such as 
      sphingomyelin. On the basis of these effects we propose a 'chaperone-like' SL 
      intervention at early stages of the AChR biosynthetic pathway, affecting both the 
      efficiency of the assembly process and subsequent receptor trafficking to the cell 
      surface.

      murinus).

AB  - In the present study, we characterized the neural regulation of esophageal striated 
      muscle in Suncus murinus (a house musk shrew; "suncus" used as a laboratory name), 
      which was compared with that in the rat. The tunica muscularis consists of striated 
      muscle in the suncus esophagus. An isolated segment of the suncus esophagus was 
      placed in an organ bath and the contractile responses were recorded using a force 
      transducer. Electrical stimulations to vagus nerves induced contractile responses in 
      the esophageal segment. Treatment with α-bungarotoxin, a blocker of nicotinic 
      acetylcholine receptors, blocked the vagally mediated contractions of the suncus 
      esophagus. D-tubocurarine and succinylcholine, typical antagonists of nicotinic 
      acetylcholine receptors, also inhibited the suncus esophageal contractions, while 
      higher concentrations of the agents were required rather than concentrations for 
      producing an equivalent block in the rat. We used capsaicin, a stimulator of 
      small-caliber afferent neurons, for activating the peripheral neural network. The 
      reagent inhibited the vagally mediated twitch contractions of striated muscle in the 
      suncus esophagus, which was reversed by pretreatment with a nitric oxide synthase 
      inhibitor, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. Application of a nitric oxide donor, 
      diethylamine NONOate diethylammonium salt, mimicked capsaicin-induced inhibition. 
      The results suggest that motility of the suncus esophagus, which consists of 
      striated muscles, is regulated by vagal cholinergic neurons. The local neural 
      network including capsaicin-sensitive neurons and intrinsic nitrergic neurons can 
      modify the vagally mediated motility in the suncus esophagus. In addition, nicotinic 
      acetylcholine receptors of the suncus esophagus might be pharmacologically distinct 
      from those of rodent esophagi.

PG  - 8995-9004
AB  - Extracellular serine proteases and their inhibitors (serpins) play a key role for 
      synaptic plasticity in the developing and adult CNS. Serpins also counteract the 
      extravasated proteases during brain injury. We studied the mechanisms by which one 
      of the most important serpins, serpinE2 or protease nexin-1 (PN-1), is secreted by 
      glial cells and how its secretion is regulated by extracellular signals. Using 
      time-lapse videomicroscopy and biochemical methods, we demonstrate that PN-1 is 
      constitutively secreted through small vesicles animated by a discontinuous movement 
      using microtubules as tracks. The F-actin network underneath the plasma membrane 
      acting as a barrier hindered PN-1 vesicle exocytosis. Vasointestinal/pituitary 
      adenylate cyclase peptides and the G-protein activator mastoparan increased PN-1 
      secretion by disrupting the F-actin barrier. The receptor-mediated regulation of 
      PN-1 constitutive secretion may be an important mechanism adapting extracellular 
      proteolytic activity to synaptic activity.

TI  - Shortcomings in snake bite management in rural Cameroon: a case report.
PG  - 196
LID - 10.1186/s13104-017-2518-8 [doi]
LID - 196
AB  - BACKGROUND: Snake bites are an important public health problem in developing 
      countries with most bites occurring in rural areas. Severe envenomation often occurs 
      in children and following bites to the face. Prompt administration of potent 
      anti-venom remains the mainstay of management. However in Cameroon, the use of 
      anti-venoms is limited by non-availability, high cost (where available) and poor 
      mastery of treatment guidelines. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a 10-year-old muslim 
      Cameroonian child from an enclaved rural area, brought to the hospital 12 h after a 
      snake bite to the face, with signs of severe envenomation. Despite the suboptimal 
      anti-venom dose administered to this patient due to a stock out of this medication, 
      supportive therapy was beneficial in ensuring a positive outcome and satisfactory 
      recovery. CONCLUSION: This highlights snake bites as a public health problem due to 
      the lack of snake anti-venoms in peripheral health facilities, rendering them unable 
      to appropriately manage these cases. National health policies should encourage 
      constant peripheral availability of anti-venoms and the institution of an 
      intervention package for snake bite management, comprising: treatment protocol, 
      staff training, monitoring of compliance and community education to help reduce the 
      mortality and morbidity from snake bites.

TI  - Structure-function relationships of the alpha/beta-hydrolase fold domain of 
      neuroligin: a comparison with acetylcholinesterase.
PG  - 49-55
LID - 10.1016/j.cbi.2010.01.030 [doi]
AB  - The neuroligins are postsynaptic cell adhesion proteins whose extracellular domain 
      belongs to the alpha/beta-hydrolase fold family of proteins, a family characterized 
      through the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and other enzymes with various 
      substrate specificities. Neuroligin associations with the pre-synaptic neurexins 
      participate in synapse maturation and maintenance. Alternative splicing of the 
      neuroligin and neurexin genes results in multiple isoforms and presumably regulation 
      of activity, while mutations appear to be associated with autism spectrum disorders. 
      The crystal structures of the extracellular, cell adhesion domain of three 
      neuroligins (NL1, NL2 and NL4) revealed features that distinguish the neuroligins 
      from their enzyme relatives and could not be predicted by homology modelling from an 
      AChE template. The structures of NL1 and NL4 bound with a soluble beta-neurexin 
      domain (Nrxbeta1) revealed the precise position and orientation of the bound 
      Nrxbeta1 and the Ca(2+)-dependent interaction network at the complex interface. 
      Herein we present an overview of the unbound and Nrxbeta1-bound neuroligin 
      structures and compare them with structures of AChEs with and without a bound 
      fasciculin partner. This study exemplifies how an alpha/beta-hydrolase fold domain 
      tailored for catalysis varies to acquire adhesion properties, and defines three 
      surface regions with distinctive locations and properties for homologous or 
      heterologous partner association.

TI  - Structural basis for metal ion coordination and the catalytic mechanism of 
      sphingomyelinases D.
PG  - 13658-64
AB  - Sphingomyelinases D (SMases D) from Loxosceles spider venom are the principal toxins 
      responsible for the manifestation of dermonecrosis, intravascular hemolysis, and 
      acute renal failure, which can result in death. These enzymes catalyze the 
      hydrolysis of sphingomyelin, resulting in the formation of ceramide 1-phosphate and 
      choline or the hydrolysis of lysophosphatidyl choline, generating the lipid mediator 
      lysophosphatidic acid. This report represents the first crystal structure of a 
      member of the sphingomyelinase D family from Loxosceles laeta (SMase I), which has 
      been determined at 1.75-angstrom resolution using the "quick cryo-soaking" technique 
      and phases obtained from a single iodine derivative and data collected from a 
      conventional rotating anode x-ray source. SMase I folds as an (alpha/beta)8 barrel, 
      the interfacial and catalytic sites encompass hydrophobic loops and a negatively 
      charged surface. Substrate binding and/or the transition state are stabilized by a 
      Mg2+ ion, which is coordinated by Glu32, Asp34, Asp91, and solvent molecules. In the 
      proposed acid base catalytic mechanism, His12 and His47 play key roles and are 
      supported by a network of hydrogen bonds between Asp34, Asp52, Trp230, Asp233, and 
      Asn252.

      agents. METHODS: In this study, we identified a nine-residue cryptic oligopeptide, 
      KRFKKFFKK (EVP50) that is repeatedly encoded in tandem within vipericidin sequences. 
      RESULTS: EVP50 displayed in vivo potent lethal toxicity to zebrafish larvae (LD50=6 
      μM) when the peptide's N-terminus was chemically conjugated to rhodamine B (RhoB). 
      In vitro, RhoB-conjugated EVP50 (RhoB-EVP50) exhibited a concentration-dependent 
      cytotoxic effect toward MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. In MCF-7 cells, 
      the RhoB-EVP50 nonapeptide accumulated inside the cells within minutes. In the 
      cytoplasm, the RhoB-EVP50 induced extracellular calcium influx and intracellular 
      calcium release. Membrane budding was also observed after incubation with micromolar 
      concentrations of the fluorescent EVP50 conjugate. CONCLUSIONS: The conjugate's 
      interference with calcium homeostasis, its intracellular accumulation and its 
      induced membrane dysfunction (budding and vacuolization) seem to act in concert to 
      disrupt the cell circuitry. Contrastively, unconjugated EVP50 peptide did not 
      display neither toxic nor cytotoxic activities in our in vivo and in vitro models. 
      GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The synergic mechanism of toxicity was restricted to the 
      structurally modified encrypted vipericidin nonapeptide.

TI  - Anti-ligand antibodies as potential autoantigens: in vitro and in vivo 
      characteristics of anti-bungarotoxin antibodies in the idiotype network.
PG  - 145-52
AB  - Some antibodies to ligands of a receptor will have combining sites that structurally 
      resemble the receptor's binding site for that ligand. The network hypothesis 
      predicts that anti-idiotypic antibodies to these anti-ligand antibodies will also 
      bind to the receptor. We pursued these hypotheses in the well-defined 
      ligand-receptor system, alpha-bungarotoxin(BTX)-acetylcholine receptor (AChR). 
      Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to BTX were generated; native BTX was used as the 
      immunogen to optimize the probability of obtaining mAbs to the AChR binding site. 
      These mAbs were then characterized for their ability to "mimic" AChR in the 
      following in vitro assays: neutralization of BTX binding to native AChR on the 
      surface of the cell line TE671, formation of a ternary complex with 125BTX-AChR, and 
      ability of cholinergic ligands to interfere with binding to BTX. Three aBTX mAbs 
      which had in vitro attributes of the AChR on the basis of these assays, were 
      injected into C3H mice and serial sera tested for antibodies to Torpedo and murine 
      AChR. Anti-AChR antibodies directed primarily to the gamma and delta subunits of the 
      Torpedo AChR were detected, as well as low amounts of anti-mouse AChR antibody. The 
      generation of anti-AChR antibodies by immunization with aBTX antibodies supports the 
      network hypothesis and provides a theoretical basis for initiation of autoimmunity 
      to cell receptors.

TI  - Cell type-specific expression of acid-sensing ion channels in hippocampal 
      interneurons.
PG  - 6548-58
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0582-10.2010 [doi]
AB  - Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), a member of the degenerin/epithelial Na+ channel 
      superfamily, are widely expressed in the mammalian CNS. Accumulating evidence 
      suggests that ASIC current density is higher in GABAergic interneurons than that in 
      glutamatergic pyramidal neurons (PNs) in the hippocampus. Such differential 
      expression of ASICs in cortical networks is thought to be a key element for seizure 
      termination. However, GABAergic interneurons are highly diverse; it is unclear 
      whether the functional expression of ASICs differs in distinct GABAergic interneuron 
      subtypes. Moreover, the subunit composition of ASICs in individual GABAergic 
      interneurons remains unknown. By combining patch-clamp recording and single-cell 
      reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis, we correlated ASIC currents with their gene 
      expression in acute rat hippocampal slices. The results yielded several surprising 
      findings. First, ASIC current density of oriens lacunosum-moleculare (O-LM) cells in 
      the CA1 region, a classical type of dendrite-targeting interneuron, is 6 times 
      greater than that of fast-spiking basket cells (BCs) in the dentate gyrus, a major 
      class of soma-targeting interneuron. Second, the recovery of ASICs from 
      desensitization is slowest in BCs, intermediate in PNs, and fastest in O-LM cells. 
      Third, the tarantula venom psalmotoxin 1, the specific blocker for ASIC1a homomers, 
      inhibits ASIC currents in BCs but not in O-LM cells. Finally, single-cell RT-PCR 
      analysis reveals coexpression of ASIC1a and ASIC2 subunit transcripts in O-LM cells, 
      whereas only ASIC1a subunit transcript is detected in most BCs. Thus, differential 
      expression of ASICs in inhibitory microcircuits likely contributes to the distinct 
      roles of GABAergic interneurons in normal physiology and pathophysiology.

TI  - Cross talk between the bombesin neuropeptide receptor and Sonic hedgehog pathways in 
      small cell lung carcinoma.
PG  - 1679-87
LID - 10.1038/onc.2014.104 [doi]
AB  - Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) often features the upregulation of the Sonic 
      hedgehog (Shh) pathway leading to activation of Gli transcription factors. SCLC 
      cells secrete bombesin (BBS)-like neuropeptides that act as autocrine growth 
      factors. Here, we show that SCLC tumor samples feature co-expression of Shh and 
      BBS-cognate receptor (gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR)). We also 
      demonstrate that BBS activates Gli in SCLC cells, which is crucial for BBS-mediated 
      SCLC proliferation, because cyclopamine, an inhibitor of the Shh pathway, hampered 
      the BBS-mediated effects. BBS binding to GRPR stimulated Gli through its downstream 
      Gαq and Gα₁₂/₁₃ GTPases, and consistently, other Gαq and Gα₁₃ coupled receptors 
      (such as muscarinic receptor, m1, and thrombin receptor, PAR-1) and constitutively 
      active GαqQL and Gα₁₂/₁₃QL mutants stimulated Gli. By using cells null for Gαq and 
      Gα₁₂/₁₃, we demonstrate that these G proteins are strictly necessary for Gli 
      activation by BBS. Moreover, by using constitutively active Rho small G-protein (Rho 
      QL) as well as its inhibitor, C3 toxin, we show that Rho mediates G-protein-coupled 
      receptor (GPCR)-, Gαq- and Gα₁₂/₁₃-dependent Gli stimulation. At the molecular 
      level, BBS caused a significant increase in Shh gene transcription and protein 
      secretion that was dependent on BBS-induced GPCR/Gαq-₁₂/₁₃/Rho mediated activation 
      of nuclear factor κB (NFκB), which can stimulate a NF-κB response element in the Shh 
      gene promoter. Our data identify a novel molecular network acting in SCLC linking 
      autocrine BBS and Shh circuitries and suggest Shh inhibitors as novel therapeutic 
      strategies against this aggressive cancer type.

      (Dinophyceae): a multidisciplinary approach.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0057291 [doi]
LID - e57291
AB  - The harmful dinoflagellate Ostreopsis cf. ovata has been causing toxic events along 
      the Mediterranean coasts and other temperate and tropical areas, with increasing 
      frequency during the last decade. Despite many studies, important biological 
      features of this species are still poorly known. An integrated study, using 
      different microscopy and molecular techniques, Raman microspectroscopy and high 
      resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HR LC-MS), was undertaken to 
      elucidate cytological aspects, and identify main metabolites including toxins. The 
      species was genetically identified as O. cf. ovata, Atlantic-Mediterranean clade. 
      The ultrastructural results show unique features of the mucilage network abundantly 
      produced by this species to colonize benthic substrates, with a new role of 
      trichocysts, never described before. The amorphous polysaccharidic component of 
      mucilage appears to derive from pusule fibrous material and mucocysts. In all stages 
      of growth, the cells show an abundant production of lipids. Different developmental 
      stages of chloroplasts are found in the peripheral cytoplasm and in the centre of 
      cell. In vivo Raman microspectroscopy confirms the presence of the carotenoid 
      peridinin in O. cf. ovata, and detects in several specimen the abundant presence of 
      unsaturated lipids structurally related to docosahexaenoic acid. The HR LC-MS 
      analysis reveals that ovatoxin-a is the predominant toxin, together with decreasing 
      amounts of ovatoxin-b, -d/e, -c and putative palytoxin. Toxins concentration on a 
      per cell basis increases from exponential to senescent phase. The results suggest 
      that benthic blooms of this species are probably related to features such as the 
      ability to create a unique mucilaginous sheath covering the sea bottom, associated 
      with the production of potent toxins as palytoxin-like compounds. In this way, O. 
      cf. ovata may be able to rapidly colonize benthic substrates outcompeting other 
      species.

TI  - K+ channels and the microglial respiratory burst.
PG  - C796-806
AB  - Microglial activation following central nervous system damage or disease often 
      culminates in a respiratory burst that is necessary for antimicrobial function, but, 
      paradoxically, can damage bystander cells. We show that several K+ channels are 
      expressed and play a role in the respiratory burst of cultured rat microglia. Three 
      pharmacologically separable K+ currents had properties of Kv1.3 and the 
      Ca2+/calmodulin-gated channels, SK2, SK3, and SK4. mRNA was detected for Kv1.3, 
      Kv1.5, SK2, and/or SK3, and SK4. Protein was detected for Kv1.3, Kv1.5, and SK3 
      (selective SK2 and SK4 antibodies not available). No Kv1.5-like current was 
      detected, and confocal immunofluorescence showed the protein to be subcellular, in 
      contrast to the robust membrane localization of Kv1.3. To determine whether any of 
      these channels play a role in microglial activation, a respiratory burst was 
      stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and measured using a single cell, 
      fluorescence-based dihydrorhodamine 123 assay. The respiratory burst was markedly 
      inhibited by blockers of SK2 (apamin) and SK4 channels (clotrimazole and 
      charybdotoxin), and to a lesser extent, by the potent Kv1.3 blocker agitoxin-2.

TI  - Synergistic roles of GABAA receptors and SK channels in regulating thalamocortical 
      oscillations.
PG  - 203-13
LID - 10.1152/jn.91158.2008 [doi]
AB  - Rhythmic oscillations throughout the cortex are observed during physiological and 
      pathological states of the brain. The thalamus generates sleep spindle oscillations 
      and spike-wave discharges characteristic of absence epilepsy. Much has been learned 
      regarding the mechanisms underlying these oscillations from in vitro brain slice 
      preparations. One widely used model to understand the epileptiform oscillations 
      underlying absence epilepsy involves application of bicuculline methiodide (BMI) to 
      brain slices containing the thalamus. BMI is a well-known GABAA receptor blocker 
      that has previously been discovered to also block small-conductance, 
      calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels. Here we report that the robust 
      epileptiform oscillations observed during BMI application rely synergistically on 
      both GABAA receptor and SK channel antagonism. Neither application of picrotoxin, a 
      selective GABAA receptor antagonist, nor application of apamin, a selective SK 
      channel antagonist, alone yielded the highly synchronized, long-lasting oscillations 
      comparable to those observed during BMI application. However, partial blockade of SK 
      channels by subnanomolar concentrations of apamin combined with picrotoxin 
      sufficiently replicated BMI oscillations. We found that, at the cellular level, 
      apamin enhanced the intrinsic excitability of reticular nucleus (RT) neurons but had 
      no effect on relay neurons. This work suggests that regulation of RT excitability by 
      SK channels can influence the excitability of thalamocortical networks and may 
      illuminate possible pharmacological treatments for absence epilepsy. Finally, our 
      results suggest that changes in the intrinsic properties of individual neurons and 
      changes at the circuit level can robustly modulate these oscillations.

TI  - Identification of a saxitoxin biosynthesis gene with a history of frequent 
      horizontal gene transfers.
PG  - 526-38
LID - 10.1007/s00239-008-9169-2 [doi]
AB  - The paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins, saxitoxin, and its derivatives, are 
      produced by a complex and unique biosynthetic pathway. It involves reactions that 
      are rare in other metabolic pathways, however, distantly related organisms, such as 
      dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria, produce these toxins by an identical pathway. 
      Speculative explanations for the unusual phylogenetic distribution of this metabolic 
      pathway have been proposed, including a polyphyletic origin, the involvement of 
      symbiotic bacteria, and horizontal gene transfer. This study describes for the first 
      time the identity of one gene, sxt1, that is involved in the biosynthesis of 
      saxitoxin in cyanobacteria. It encoded an O-carbamoyltransferase (OCTASE) that was 
      proposed to carbamoylate the hydroxymethyl side chain of saxitoxin precursor. 
      Orthologues of sxt1 were exclusively present in PSP-toxic strains of cyanobacteria 
      and had a high sequence similarity to each other. L. wollei had a naturally mutated 
      sxt1 gene that encoded an inactive enzyme, and was incapable of producing 
      carbamoylated PSP-toxin analogues, supporting the proposed function of Sxt1. 
      Phylogenetic analysis revealed that OCATSE genes were present exclusively in 
      prokaryotic organisms and were characterized by a high rate of horizontal gene 
      transfer. OCTASE has most likely evolved from an ancestral O-sialoglycoprotein 
      endopeptidase from proteobacteria, whereas the most likely phylogenetic origin of 
      sxt1 was an ancestral alpha-proteobacterium. The phylogeny of sxt1 suggested that 
      the entire set of genes required for saxitoxin biosynthesis may spread by horizontal 
      gene transfer.

AB  - Decanoic acid-modified glycol chitosan (DA-GC) hydrogels containing tightly adsorbed 
      palmitic acid-modified exendin-4 (Ex4-C16) were prepared, and their pharmaceutical 
      abilities as a long-acting sustained-release exendin-4 system for the treatment of 
      diabetes were evaluated. Glycol chitosan (GC) was conjugated with 
      N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated decanoic acid (DA) in anhydrous 0.4% 
      dimethylaminopyridine/dimethylsulfoxide at different feed ratios. DA-GC hydrogels 
      formed by physical self-assembly during dialysis vs. deionized water, and their 
      inner network structures, swelling or gel-forming abilities and release properties 
      were examined. The hypoglycemia caused by Ex4-C16-loaded DA-GC hydrogels was 
      evaluated by subcutaneous administration in type 2 diabetic db/db mice. The results 
      obtained showed that GC prepared at a DA:GC feed ratio of 1:100 had optimal 
      properties with respect to hydrogel swelling, stiffness and Ex4-C16 incorporation, 
      whereas DA-GC hydrogels prepared at a feed ratio of greater than 1:100 formed gels 
      that were too stiff. The in vitro and in vivo release of Ex4-C16 from DA-GC 
      hydrogels was dramatically delayed compared with native Ex4 probably due to strong 
      hydrophobic interactions. In particular, Ex4-C16 in DA-GC hydrogels was found to be 
      present around the injection site up to 10 days after subcutaneous administration, 
      whereas Ex4 in DA-GC hydrogels was cleared from injection sites in ≈ 2 days in ICR 
      mice. Finally, the hypoglycemia induced by Ex4-C16 DA-GC hydrogels was maintained 
      for >7 days. Our findings demonstrate that Ex4-C16 DA-GC hydrogels offer a potential 
      delivery system for the long-term treatment of type 2 diabetes.

TI  - An experimentally constrained computational model of NMDA oscillations in lamprey 
      CPG neurons.
PG  - 108-21
AB  - Rhythmicity is a characteristic of neural networks responsible for locomotion. In 
      many organisms, activation of N-methyl-D: -aspartate (NMDA) receptors leads to 
      generation of rhythmic locomotor patterns. In addition, single neurons can display 
      intrinsic, NMDA-dependent membrane potential oscillations when pharmacologically 
      isolated from each other by tetrodotoxin (TTX) application. Such NMDA-TTX 
      oscillations have been characterized, for instance, in lamprey locomotor network 
      neurons. Conceptual and computational models have been put forward to explain the 
      appearance and characteristics of these oscillations. Here, we seek to refine the 
      understanding of NMDA-TTX oscillations by combining new experimental evidence with 
      computational modelling. We find that, in contrast to previous computational 
      predictions, the oscillation frequency tends to increase when the NMDA concentration 
      is increased. We develop a new, minimal computational model which can incorporate 
      this new information. This model is further constrained by another new piece of 
      experimental evidence: that regular-looking NMDA-TTX oscillations can be obtained 
      even after voltage-dependent potassium and high-voltage-activated calcium channels 
      have been pharmacologically blocked. Our model conforms to several experimentally 
      derived criteria that we have set up and is robust to parameter changes, as 
      evaluated through sensitivity analysis. We use the model to re-analyze an old 
      NMDA-TTX oscillation model, and suggest an explanation of why it failed to reproduce 
      the new experimental data that we present here.

TI  - Bone marrow-derived cells do not engraft into skeletal muscle microvasculature but 
      promote angiogenesis after acute injury.
PG  - 238-249.e3

AB  - The skeletal muscle is supported by a vast network of microvessels with the capacity 
      to regenerate in response to injury. However, the dynamics of microvascular repair 
      and the origin of reconstituted endothelial cells in the skeletal muscle are poorly 
      understood. A growing body of literature exists to indicate bone marrow (BM)-derived 
      cells engraft into regenerating vascular endothelium and muscle macrovasculature. 
      Therefore, we investigated the extent of BM contribution to skeletal muscle 
      microvasculature after acute injury. Because reporters and markers commonly used to 
      trace donor BM cells are not endothelial specific but are also expressed by 
      leukocytes, we generated novel BM chimeras utilizing Tie2-green fluorescent protein 
      BM cells transplanted into CD31 and Caveolin-1 knockout recipients. In turn, we 
      surveyed BM vascular contribution, not just by the presence of green fluorescent 
      protein, but also CD31 and Caveolin-1, respectively. After stable BM reconstitution, 
      chimera limb muscles were cardiotoxin (CTX) injured and examined 21 days post-injury 
      for the presence of green fluorescent protein, CD31, and Caveolin-1. Acute muscle 
      injury by CTX is characterized by initial microvasculature death followed by rapid 
      endothelial regeneration within 14 days post-damage. Histological analysis of 
      injured and uninjured contralateral limb muscles revealed a complete absence of BM 
      engraftment in the muscle vasculature of wild-type and CD31/Caveolin-1 knockout 
      chimeras. In contrast, F4/80(+) cells isolated from CTX-injured muscle, expressed 
      endothelial-related markers and promoted angiogenesis in vitro. Therefore, despite 
      the absence of BM engraftment to regenerated skeletal muscle microvasculature, 
      macrophages recruited after injury promote angiogenesis and, in turn, vascular 
      regeneration.

TI  - Myotonic dystrophy transgenic mice exhibit pathologic abnormalities in diaphragm 
      neuromuscular junctions and phrenic nerves.
PG  - 763-72
LID - 10.1097/NEN.0b013e318180ec64 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy Type 1 (DM-1) is caused by abnormal expansion of a (CTG) repeat 
      located in the DM protein kinase gene. Respiratory problems have long been 
      recognized to be a major feature of this disorder. Because respiratory failure can 
      be associated with dysfunction of phrenic nerves and diaphragm muscle, we examined 
      the diaphragm and respiratory neural network in transgenic mice carrying the human 
      genomic DM-1 region with expanded repeats of more than 300 CTG, a valid model of the 
      human disease. Morphologic and morphometric analyses revealed distal denervation of 
      diaphragm neuromuscular junctions in DM-1 transgenic mice indicated by a decrease in 
      the size and shape complexity of end-plates and a reduction in the concentration of 
      acetyl choline receptors on the postsynaptic membrane. More importantly, there was a 
      significant reduction in numbers of unmyelinated, but not of myelinated, fibers in 
      DM-1 phrenic nerves; no morphologic alternations of the nerves or loss of neuronal 
      cells were detected in medullary respiratory centers or cervical phrenic motor 
      neurons. Because neuromuscular junctions are involved in action potential 
      transmission and the afferent phrenic unmyelinated fibers control the inspiratory 
      activity, our results suggest that the respiratory impairment associated with DM-1 
      may be partially due to pathologic alterations in neuromuscular junctions and 
      phrenic nerves.

TI  - Heterogeneity in Kv2 Channel Expression Shapes Action Potential Characteristics and 
      Firing Patterns in CA1 versus CA2 Hippocampal Pyramidal Neurons.
LID - 10.1523/ENEURO.0267-17.2017 [doi]
LID - ENEURO.0267-17.2017
AB  - The CA1 region of the hippocampus plays a critical role in spatial and contextual 
      memory, and has well-established circuitry, function and plasticity. In contrast, 
      the properties of the flanking CA2 pyramidal neurons (PNs), important for social 
      memory, and lacking CA1-like plasticity, remain relatively understudied. In 
      particular, little is known regarding the expression of voltage-gated K(+) (Kv) 
      channels and the contribution of these channels to the distinct properties of 
      intrinsic excitability, action potential (AP) waveform, firing patterns and 
      neurotransmission between CA1 and CA2 PNs. In the present study, we used multiplex 
      fluorescence immunolabeling of mouse brain sections, and whole-cell recordings in 
      acute mouse brain slices, to define the role of heterogeneous expression of Kv2 
      family Kv channels in CA1 versus CA2 pyramidal cell excitability. Our results show 
      that the somatodendritic delayed rectifier Kv channel subunits Kv2.1, Kv2.2, and 
      their auxiliary subunit AMIGO-1 have region-specific differences in expression in 
      PNs, with the highest expression levels in CA1, a sharp decrease at the CA1-CA2 
      boundary, and significantly reduced levels in CA2 neurons. PNs in CA1 exhibit a 
      robust contribution of Guangxitoxin-1E-sensitive Kv2-based delayed rectifier current 
      to AP shape and after-hyperpolarization potential (AHP) relative to that seen in CA2 
      PNs. Our results indicate that robust Kv2 channel expression confers a distinct 
      pattern of intrinsic excitability to CA1 PNs, potentially contributing to their 
      different roles in hippocampal network function.

TI  - Systems biology of coagulation initiation: kinetics of thrombin generation in 
      resting and activated human blood.
LID - e1000950 [pii]
LID - 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000950 [doi]
AB  - Blood function defines bleeding and clotting risks and dictates approaches for 
      clinical intervention. Independent of adding exogenous tissue factor (TF), human 
      blood treated in vitro with corn trypsin inhibitor (CTI, to block Factor XIIa) will 
      generate thrombin after an initiation time (T(i)) of 1 to 2 hours (depending on 
      donor), while activation of platelets with the GPVI-activator convulxin reduces T(i) 
      to ∼20 minutes. Since current kinetic models fail to generate thrombin in the 
      absence of added TF, we implemented a Platelet-Plasma ODE model accounting for: the 
      Hockin-Mann protease reaction network, thrombin-dependent display of platelet 
      phosphatidylserine, VIIa function on activated platelets, XIIa and XIa generation 
      and function, competitive thrombin substrates (fluorogenic detector and fibrinogen), 
      and thrombin consumption during fibrin polymerization. The kinetic model consisting 
      of 76 ordinary differential equations (76 species, 57 reactions, 105 kinetic 
      parameters) predicted the clotting of resting and convulxin-activated human blood as 
      well as predicted T(i) of human blood under 50 different initial conditions that 
      titrated increasing levels of TF, Xa, Va, XIa, IXa, and VIIa. Experiments with 
      combined anti-XI and anti-XII antibodies prevented thrombin production, 
      demonstrating that a leak of XIIa past saturating amounts of CTI (and not 
      "blood-borne TF" alone) was responsible for in vitro initiation without added TF. 
      Clotting was not blocked by antibodies used individually against TF, VII/VIIa, 
      P-selectin, GPIb, protein disulfide isomerase, cathepsin G, nor blocked by the 
      ribosome inhibitor puromycin, the Clk1 kinase inhibitor Tg003, or inhibited VIIa 
      (VIIai). This is the first model to predict the observed behavior of CTI-treated 
      human blood, either resting or stimulated with platelet activators. CTI-treated 
      human blood will clot in vitro due to the combined activity of XIIa and XIa, a 
      process enhanced by platelet activators and which proceeds in the absence of any 
      evidence for kinetically significant blood borne tissue factor.

AB  - Although the possibility of developing cardiac steroids/cardiac glycosides as novel 
      cancer therapeutic agents has been recognized, the mechanism of their anticancer 
      activity is still not clear enough. Toad venom extract containing bufadienolides, 
      which belong to cardiac steroids, has actually long been used as traditional Chinese 
      medicine in clinic for cancer therapy in China. The cytotoxicity of arenobufagin, a 
      bufadienolide isolated from toad venom, on human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells was 
      checked. And, the protein expression profile of control HeLa cells and HeLa cells 
      treated with arenobufagin for 48 h was analyzed using two-dimensional 
      electrophoresis, respectively. Differently expressed proteins in HeLa cells treated 
      with arenobufagin were identified and the pathways related to these proteins were 
      mapped from KEGG database. Computational molecular docking was performed to verify 
      the binding of arenobufagin and Na, K-ATPase. The effects of arenobufagin on Na, 
      K-ATPase activity and proteasome activity of HeLa cells were checked. The 
      protein-protein interaction network between Na, K-ATPase and proteasome was 
      constructed and the expression of possible intermediate proteins ataxin-1 and 
      translationally-controlled tumor protein in HeLa cells treated with arenobufagin was 
      then checked. Arenobufagin induced apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle arrest in HeLa 
      cells. The cytotoxic effect of arenobufagin was associated with 25 differently 
      expressed proteins including proteasome-related proteins, calcium ion 
      binding-related proteins, oxidative stress-related proteins, metabolism-related 
      enzymes and others. The results of computational molecular docking revealed that 
      arenobufagin was bound in the cavity formed by the transmembrane alpha subunits of 
      Na, K-ATPase, which blocked the pathway of extracellular Na+/K+ cation exchange and 
      inhibited the function of ion exchange. Arenobufagin inhibited the activity of Na, 
      K-ATPase and proteasome, decreased the expression of Na, K-ATPase α1 and α3 subunits 
      and increased the expression of WEE1 in HeLa cells. Antibodies against Na, K-ATPase 
      α1 and α3 subunits alone or combinated with arenobufagin also inhibited the activity 
      of proteasome. Furthermore, the expression of the possible intermediate proteins 
      ataxin-1 and translationally-controlled tumor protein was increased in HeLa cells 
      treated with arenobufagin by flow cytometry analysis, respectively. These results 
      indicated that arenobufagin might directly bind with Na, K-ATPase α1 and α3 subunits 
      and the inhibitive effect of arenobufagin on proteasomal activity of HeLa cells 
      might be related to its binding with Na, K-ATPase.

TI  - Non-strict strand orientation of the Ca2+-induced dimerization of a conantokin 
      peptide variant with sequence-shifted gamma-carboxyglutamate residues.
PG  - 866-72
LID - 10.1016/j.peptides.2009.01.010 [doi]
AB  - We have previously found a new mode of metal ion-induced helix-helix assembly for 
      the gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla)-containing, neuroactive conantokin (con) peptides 
      that is independent of the hydrophobic effect. In these unique "metallo-zipper" 
      assemblies of con-G and con-T[K7gamma], interhelical Ca(2+) coordination induces 
      dimer formation with strictly antiparallel chain orientation in conantokin peptides 
      in which Gla residues are positioned at "i, i+4, i+7, i+11" intervals. In order to 
      probe the property of self-assembly in conantokin peptides with an extended Gla 
      network, a con-T variant (con-T-tri) was synthesized that contains five Gla residues 
      spaced at "i, i+4, i+7, i+11, i+14" intervals. Sedimentation equilibrium analyses 
      showed that Ca(2+), but not Mg(2+), was capable of promoting con-T-tri 
      self-assembly. Oxidation and rearrangement assays with Cys-containing con-T-tri 
      variants revealed that the peptide strands in the complex can orient in both 
      parallel and antiparallel forms. Stable parallel and antiparallel dimeric forms of 
      con-T-tri were modeled using disulfide-linked peptides and the biological viability 
      of these species was confirmed by electrophysiology. These findings suggest that 
      small changes within the helix-helix interface of the conantokins can be exploited 
      to achieve desired modes of strand alignment.

TI  - Rb and p107 are required for alpha cell survival, beta cell cycle control and 
      glucagon-like peptide-1 action.
PG  - 2555-65
LID - 10.1007/s00125-014-3381-y [doi]
AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Diabetes mellitus is characterised by beta cell loss and alpha cell 
      expansion. Analogues of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) are used therapeutically to 
      antagonise these processes; thus, we hypothesised that the related cell cycle 
      regulators retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and p107 were involved in GLP-1 action. 
      METHODS: We used small interfering RNA and adenoviruses to manipulate Rb and p107 
      expression in insulinoma and alpha-TC cell lines. In vivo we examined 
      pancreas-specific Rb knockout, whole-body p107 knockout and Rb/p107 double-knockout 
      mice. RESULTS: Rb, but not p107, was downregulated in response to the GLP-1 
      analogue, exendin-4, in both alpha and beta cells. Intriguingly, this resulted in 
      opposite outcomes of cell cycle arrest in alpha cells but proliferation in beta 
      cells. Overexpression of Rb in alpha and beta cells abolished or attenuated the 
      effects of exendin-4 supporting the important role of Rb in GLP-1 modulation of cell 
      cycling. Similarly, in vivo, Rb, but not p107, deficiency was required for the beta 
      cell proliferative response to exendin-4. Consistent with this finding, Rb, but not 
      p107, was suppressed in islets from humans with diabetes, suggesting the importance 
      of Rb regulation for the compensatory proliferation that occurs under insulin 
      resistant conditions. Finally, while p107 alone did not have an essential role in 
      islet homeostasis, when combined with Rb deletion, its absence potentiated apoptosis 
      of both alpha and beta cells resulting in glucose intolerance and diminished islet 
      mass with ageing. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We found a central role of Rb in the 
      dual effects of GLP-1 in alpha and beta cells. Our findings highlight unique 
      contributions of individual Rb family members to islet cell proliferation and 
      survival.

TI  - Actin cytoskeleton of rabbit intestinal cells is a target for potent marine 
      phycotoxins.
PG  - 4345-54
AB  - Biotoxins produced by harmful marine microalgae (phycotoxins) can be accumulated 
      into seafood, representing a great risk for public health. Some of these phycotoxins 
      are responsible for a variety of gastrointestinal disturbances; however, the 
      relationship between their mechanism of action and toxicity in intestinal cells is 
      still unknown. The actin cytoskeleton is an important and highly complicated 
      structure in intestinal cells, and on that basis our aim has been to investigate the 
      effect of representative phycotoxins on the enterocyte cytoskeleton. We have 
      quantified for the first time the loss of enterocyte microfilament network induced 
      by each toxin and recorded fluorescence images using a laser-scanning cytometer and 
      confocal microscopy. Our data show that pectenotoxin-6, maitotoxin, palytoxin and 
      ostreocin-D cause a significant reduction in the actin cytoskeleton. In addition, we 
      found that the potency of maitotoxin, palytoxin and ostreocin-D to damage 
      filamentous actin is related to Ca(2+) influx in enterocytes. Those results identify 
      the cytoskeleton as an early target for the toxic effect of those toxins.

TI  - Bicuculline block of small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels.
PG  - 314-21
AB  - Small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels (SK channels) are gated 
      solely by intracellular calcium ions and their activity is responsible for the slow 
      afterhyperpolarization (AHP) that follows an action potential in many excitable 
      cells. Brain slice studies commonly employ a methyl derivative of bicuculline 
      (bicuculline-m), a GABAA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptor antagonist, to diminish 
      the tonic inhibitory influences of GABAergic synapses, or to investigate the role of 
      these synapses in specialized neural networks. However, recent evidence suggests 
      that bicuculline-m may not be specific for GABAA receptors and may also block the 
      slow AHP. Therefore, the effects of bicuculline-m on cloned apamin-sensitive SK2 and 
      apamin-insensitive SK1 channels were examined following expression in Xenopus 
      oocytes. The results show that at concentrations employed for slice recordings, 
      bicuculline-m potently blocks both apamin-sensitive SK2 currents and 
      apamin-insensitive SK1 currents when applied to outside-out patches. 
      Apamin-insensitive SK1 currents run down in excised patches. The potency of 
      bicuculline-m block also decreases with time after patch excision. Site-directed 
      mutagenesis that changes two residues in the outer vestibule of the SK1 pore that 
      confers apamin sensitivity also reduces run down of the current in patches, and 
      endows stable sensitivity to bicuculline-m indistinguishable from SK2. Therefore, 
      the use of bicuculline-m in slice recordings may mask apamin-sensitive slow AHPs 
      that are important determinants of neuronal excitability. In addition, 
      bicuculline-m-insensitive slow AHPs may indicate that the underlying channels have 
      run down.

TI  - Preclinical assessment of the neutralizing capacity of antivenoms produced in six 
      Latin American countries against medically-relevant Bothrops snake venoms.
PG  - 980-9

AB  - Species of the genus Bothrops induce the vast majority of snakebite envenomings in 
      Latin America. A preclinical study was performed in the context of a regional 
      network of public laboratories involved in the production, quality control and 
      development of antivenoms in Latin America. The ability of seven polyspecific 
      antivenoms, produced in Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, Colombia and Costa Rica, 
      to neutralize lethal, hemorrhagic, coagulant, defibrinogenating and myotoxic 
      activities of the venoms of Bothrops neuwiedi (diporus) (Argentina), Bothrops 
      jararaca (Brazil), B. neuwiedi (mattogrossensis) (Bolivia), Bothrops atrox (Peru and 
      Colombia) and Bothrops asper (Costa Rica) was assessed using standard laboratory 
      tests. Despite differences in the venom mixtures used in the immunization of animals 
      for the production of these antivenoms, a pattern of extensive cross-neutralization 
      was observed between these antivenoms and all the venoms tested, with quantitative 
      differences in the values of effective doses. This study reveals the capacity of 
      these antivenoms to neutralize, in preclinical tests, homologous and heterologous 
      Bothrops venoms in Central and South America, and also highlight quantitative 
      differences in the values of Median Effective Doses (ED50s) between the various 
      antivenoms.

TI  - An improved functional assay for rapid detection of marine toxins, saxitoxin and 
      brevetoxin using a portable cardiomyocyte-based potential biosensor.

AB  - Saxitoxin (STX) and brevetoxin (PbTX-2), which are produced by marine 
      dinoflagellates, are highly-toxic marine toxins targeting separate sites of the α 
      subunit of voltage-dependent sodium channels (VDSCs). In this work, a portable 
      cardiomyocyte-based potential biosensor is designed for rapid detection of STX and 
      PbTX-2. This potential biosensor is constructed by cardiomyocyte and microelectrode 
      array (MEA) with a label-free and real-time wireless 8-channel recording system 
      which can dynamically monitor the multisite electrical activity of cardiomyocyte 
      network. The recording signal parameters, spike amplitude, firing rate and 50% of 
      spike potential duration (SPD50) extracted from extracelluar field potential (EFP) 
      signals of the potential biosensor is analyzed to quantitatively evaluate 
      toxicological risk of STX and PbTX-2. Firing rate of biosensor signals presents high 
      sensitivity to STX with the detection limit of 0.35 ng/ml within 5 min. SPD50 shows 
      high sensitivity to PbTX-2 with the detection limit of 1.55 ng/ml within 5 min. 
      Based on the multi-parameter analysis, cardiomyocyte-based potential biosensor will 
      be a promising tool for rapid detection of these two toxins.

TI  - Botrocetin/VWF-induced signaling through GPIb-IX-V produces TxA2 in an 
      alphaIIbbeta3- and aggregation-independent manner.
PG  - 2750-6
AB  - Binding of von Willebrand factor (VWF) to the platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP) 
      Ib-IX-V complex initiates a signaling cascade that causes alphaIIbbeta3 activation 
      and platelet aggregation. Previous work demonstrated that botrocetin 
      (bt)/VWF-mediated agglutination activates alphaIIbbeta3 and elicits adenosine 
      triphosphate (ATP) secretion in a thromboxane A2 (TxA2)- and Ca2+-dependent manner. 
      This agglutination-elicited TxA2 production occurs in the absence of ATP secretion. 
      However, the signaling components and signaling network or pathway activated by 
      GPIb-mediated agglutination to cause TxA2 production have not been identified. 
      Therefore, the focus of this study was to elucidate at least part of the signal 
      transduction network or pathway activated by GPIb-mediated agglutination to cause 
      TxA2 production. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) selective inhibitor 
      wortmannin, and mouse platelets deficient in Lyn, Src, Syk, Src homology 2 (SH2) 
      domain-containing leukocyte protein 76 (SLP-76), phospholipase Cgamma2 (PLCgamma2), 
      linker for activation of T cells (LAT), or Fc receptor gamma-chain (FcRgamma-chain) 
      were used for these studies. LAT and FcRgamma-chain were found not to be required 
      for agglutination-driven TxA2 production or activation of alphaIIbbeta3, but were 
      required for granule secretion and aggregation. The results also clearly demonstrate 
      that bt/VWF-mediated agglutination-induced TxA2 production is dependent on signaling 
      apparently initiated by Lyn, enhanced by Src, and propagated through Syk, SLP-76, 
      PI3K, PLCgamma2, and protein kinase C (PKC).

TI  - Role of alpha7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in tetanic stimulation-induced 
      gamma oscillations in rat hippocampal slices.
PG  - 869-80
AB  - Hippocampal gamma oscillations, as a form of neuronal network synchronization, are 
      speculated to be associated with learning, memory and attention. Nicotinic 
      acetylcholine receptor alpha7 subtypes (alpha7-nAChRs) are highly expressed in 
      hippocampal neurons and play important roles in modulating neuronal function, 
      synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. However, little is known about the role of 
      alpha7-nAChRs in hippocampal gamma oscillations. Here, we examined the effects of 
      selective alpha7- and non-alpha7-nAChR antagonists on tetanic gamma oscillations in 
      rat hippocampal slices. We found that brief tetanic stimulation-induced gamma 
      oscillations (30-80 Hz) and pharmacological blockade of alpha7-nAChRs using the 
      relatively selective alpha7-nAChR antagonists, methyllycaconitine (10 or 100 nM) or 
      alpha-bungarotoxin (10 nM), significantly reduced the frequency spectrum power, the 
      number of spikes, and burst duration of evoked gamma oscillations. Neither 
      mecamylamine nor dihydro-beta-erythroidine, which are selective antagonists of 
      non-alpha7-nAChRs, demonstrated significant effects on tetanic gamma oscillations. 
      Nicotine exposure promotes hippocampal gamma oscillations in a 
      methyllycaconitine-sensitive manner. It is concluded that alpha7-nAChRs in 
      hippocampal slices play important roles in regulation of gamma oscillations, thus 
      potentially helping to explain roles of nAChRs in cognitive functions such as 
      learning, memory and attention.

AB  - Structurally similar but functionally different two paralogous proteins, CTX1 (a 
      cardiotoxin) and LNTX2 (an alpha-neurotoxin), from venom of Naja naja naja have been 
      homology modeled and subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at four 
      different temperatures (298 K, 310 K, 373 K & 473 K) under close quarters of 
      physiological conditions. Each MD simulation was performed for 25 ns and trajectory 
      structures stored at every 25 ps were used to probe various structural events 
      occurring in the temperature-induced unfolding of the proteins. Notwithstanding 
      their similar scaffolds, the two proteins are drastically differing in their 
      unfolding stabilities from each other. The structural orders of flexibilities for 
      the CTX1 and LNTX2 were found to be loop II > loop III > loop I > C-terminal and 
      C-terminal > loop I > loop III > loop II, respectively. Based on the comprehensive 
      analyses of the simulation data and studies on the various structural interactions 
      of all cardiotoxins (CTXs) and alpha-neurotoxins (NTXs) for which three-dimensional 
      structures determined by experimental techniques are available to date, we have 
      herein proposed a hypothesis ('CN network') rationalizing the differential 
      stabilities of the CTXs and NTXs belonging to a three-finger toxin superfamily of 
      snake venoms.

TI  - Effect of GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment on body weight in obese 
      antipsychotic-treated patients with schizophrenia: a randomized, placebo-controlled 
      trial.
PG  - 162-171
LID - 10.1111/dom.12795 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Schizophrenia is associated with cardiovascular co-morbidity and a reduced 
      life-expectancy of up to 20 years. Antipsychotics are dopamine D(2) receptor 
      antagonists and are the standard of medical care in schizophrenia, but the drugs are 
      associated with severe metabolic side effects such as obesity and diabetes. 
      Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are registered for treatment of 
      both obesity and type 2 diabetes. We investigated metabolic effects of the GLP-1RA, 
      exenatide once-weekly, in non-diabetic, antipsychotic-treated, obese patients with 
      schizophrenia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Antipsychotic-treated, obese, non-diabetic, 
      schizophrenia spectrum patients were randomized to double-blinded adjunctive 
      treatment with once-weekly subcutaneous exenatide (n = 23) or placebo (n = 22) 
      injections for 3 months. The primary outcome was loss of body weight after treatment 
      and repeated measures analysis of variance was used as statistical analysis. 
      RESULTS: Between March 2013 and June 2015, 40 patients completed the trial. At 
      baseline, mean body weight was 118.3 ± 16.0 kg in the exenatide group and 111.7 ± 
      18.0 kg in the placebo group, with no group differences ( P = .23). The exenatide 
      and placebo groups experienced significant ( P = .004), however similar ( P = .98), 
      weight losses of 2.24 ± 3.3 and 2.23 ± 4.4 kg, respectively, after 3 months of 
      treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with exenatide once-weekly did not promote weight 
      loss in obese, antipsychotic-treated patients with schizophrenia compared to 
      placebo. Our results could suggest that the body weight-lowering effect of GLP-1RAs 
      involves dopaminergic signaling, but blockade of other receptor systems may also 
      play a role. Nevertheless, anti-obesity regimens effective in the general population 
      may not be readily implemented in antipsychotic-treated patients with schizophrenia.

      increases in I(h).
PG  - 1542-51
AB  - Hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by theta-burst pairing of Schaffer 
      collateral inputs and postsynaptic firing is associated with localized increases in 
      synaptic strength and dendritic excitability. Using the same protocol, we now 
      demonstrate a decrease in cellular excitability that was blocked by the h-channel 
      blocker ZD7288. This decrease was also induced by postsynaptic theta-burst firing 
      alone, yet it was blocked by NMDA receptor antagonists, postsynaptic Ca2+ chelation, 
      low concentrations of tetrodotoxin, omega-conotoxin MVIIC, 
      calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) inhibitors and a protein 
      synthesis inhibitor. Increasing network activity with high extracellular K+ caused a 
      similar reduction of cellular excitability and an increase in h-channel HCN1 
      protein. We propose that backpropagating action potentials open glutamate-bound NMDA 
      receptors, resulting in an increase in I(h) and a decrease in overall excitability. 
      The occurrence of such a reduction in cellular excitability in parallel with 
      synaptic potentiation would be a negative feedback mechanism to normalize neuronal 
      output firing and thus promote network stability.

TI  - Pyrethroid modulation of spontaneous neuronal excitability and neurotransmission in 
      hippocampal neurons in culture.
PG  - 213-25
LID - 10.1016/j.neuro.2007.11.005 [doi]
AB  - Pyrethroid insecticides have potent actions on voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC), 
      inhibiting inactivation and increasing channel open times. These are thought to 
      underlie, at least in part, the clinical symptoms of pyrethroid intoxication. 
      However, disruption of neuronal activity at higher levels of organization is less 
      well understood. In order to characterize pyrethroid effects on neurotransmitter 
      release and neuronal excitability in glutamatergic networks, we examined the effects 
      of deltamethrin (DM) and permethrin (PM) on neuronal activity in hippocampal 
      neuronal cultures using patch-clamp and microelectrode array (MEA) recordings. In 
      the presence of inhibitors of GABA receptors, spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic 
      currents (sEPSCs) and spontaneous spike rates were reduced in a 
      concentration-dependent manner by both DM and PM. IC(50) values were 0.037 and 
      0.70microM for inhibition of sEPSCs and 0.60 and 21.8microM for inhibition of 
      spontaneous spike rate by DM and PM, respectively. Both compounds altered burst 
      activity by decreasing the number of spikes during spontaneous bursting, the number 
      of sEPSCs within a bursting release event and the duration of sEPSC bursts while 
      increasing both the interspike interval and the time between sEPSCs. Exposure of 
      neurons to the VGSC-specific modulator veratridine had effects similar to both DM 
      and PM, while inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels had no effect on 
      spontaneous spike rates. In the absence of GABA receptor antagonists, both DM and PM 
      increased spontaneous spike rates. Altogether, these data demonstrate that DM and PM 
      disrupt network activity in vitro, largely via a VGSC-dependent mechanism.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite recent deaths caused by box jellyfish envenomation occurring on 
      the islands of Samui and Pha-ngan in the Gulf of Thailand, many people do not 
      believe box jellyfish can kill humans and many people dismiss the problem as 
      insignificant. More evidence has been requested from the communities in order to 
      evaluate the need for and the implementation of sustainable prevention measures. We 
      aimed to determine the magnitude of cases of severe stinging by box jellyfish and 
      describe the characteristics of these cases on the islands of Samui and Pha-ngan in 
      Surat Thani Province from 1997 to 2015. METHODS: Various strategies were integrated 
      prospectively. Toxic jellyfish networks and surveillance system were established. 
      Outbreak investigations were conducted retrospectively and prospectively from 2008 
      to 2015. RESULTS: There were 15 box jellyfish cases. A small majority of them were 
      women (60.0) with a median age of 26.0 years (range 5.0-45.0 years). The highest 
      incidence by month were August (33.3%), September and October (20.0%), and July 
      (13.3%). Eight cases occurred on Samui (53.3%), 6 cases on Pha-ngan island (40.0%), 
      and one case on the boat. All cases developed symptoms and signs immediately after 
      being stung. More than half of the cases were unconscious. There were six fatal 
      cases (46.7%). The wound characteristics had an appearance similar to caterpillar 
      tracks or step ladder-like burn marks. Almost all cases involved Chirodropidae. One 
      fatal case received fresh water and ice packs applied to the wounds (16.7%). Among 
      the cases with known first aid, only one out of six fatal cases had vinegar applied 
      to the wounds (16.7%), while haft of six surviving cases received the vinegar 
      treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The islands of Samui and Pha-ngan have the highest incidence 
      of fatal and near fatal box jellyfish cases in Thailand. There is an urgent need for 
      informed pre-clinical emergent care. Optimal pre-clinical care is an area of active 
      research.

AB  - Acute renal failure following vasculotoxic viperine snake bites is very common in 
      South Asia. Acute tubular necrosis and acute cortical necrosis are the common 
      findings, with acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) being a rare presentation. We 
      conducted renal biopsies in all patients who were admitted in our institute with 
      viperine snake bite-related acute kidney injury (AKI) and who did not improve after 
      three weeks of supportive care. Patients who had findings of AIN on renal histology 
      were included for this study. Of a total of 42 patients, there were five patients 
      (11.9%) with AIN. Our series of five patients is the largest series of this rare 
      presentation in the literature. All of these five patients had features of severe 
      envenomation, severe AKI network stage of AKI and very high antivenom requirements. 
      They had a very prolonged stay in the hospital, and four of the five patients 
      developed chronic kidney disease on follow-up. The overall outcome in this group was 
      worse as compared with those who did not have AIN. AIN following viperine snake 
      bites is not a very rare presentation. The reason for the development of this 
      pathology is unclear, but direct venom-related effects are possible. This 
      presentation portends a poor overall long-term prognosis as demonstrated in our case 
      series.

TI  - N-terminal insertion and C-terminal ankyrin-like repeats of alpha-latrotoxin are 
      critical for Ca2+-dependent exocytosis.
PG  - 10188-97
AB  - Alpha-latrotoxin, a potent stimulator of exocytosis from neurons and neuroendocrine 
      cells, has been studied intensively, but the mechanisms of its actions are poorly 
      understood. Here, we developed a new method to generate active recombinant 
      alpha-latrotoxin and conducted a structure/function analysis of the toxin in 
      stimulating Ca2+-dependent exocytosis. alpha-Latrotoxin consists of a conserved 
      N-terminal domain and C-terminal ankyrin-like repeats. After cleavage of an 
      N-terminally fused purification tag of glutathione S-transferase (GST), the 
      recombinant toxin strongly stimulated exocytosis, whereas the GST-fused toxin was 
      much less potent. The GST-fused toxin bound to the receptors [neurexin 1alpha; CL1 
      (CIRL/latrophilin 1)] as efficiently as did the GST-cleaved toxin but was much less 
      effective in inserting into the plasma membrane and inducing cation conductance. The 
      toxin with deletion of the last two ankyrin-like repeats still bound the receptors 
      but could neither stimulate exocytosis nor induce cation conductance efficiently. 
      The abilities of the mutated toxins to stimulate exocytosis correlated well with 
      their abilities to induce cation conductance, but not their binding to the 
      receptors. Our results indicate that (1) C-terminal ankyrin-like repeats and a free 
      (unfused) N terminus are both required for the toxin to form pores, which is 
      essential for Ca2+-dependent exocytosis, and (2) receptor binding alone is not 
      sufficient to stimulate Ca2+-dependent exocytosis.

TI  - Role of ERp46 in β-cell lipoapoptosis through endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway 
      as well as the protective effect of exendin-4.
PG  - 324-9
LID - S0006-291X(12)01591-4 [pii]

AB  - Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is considered as a key factor in free fatty acid 
      (FFA)-induced apoptosis. ERp46, a new member of the thioredoxin family, is highly 
      expressed in pancreatic β-cells and plays an important role in glucose toxicity. In 
      this study we examined the potential role of ERp46 in palmitic acid (PA)-induced 
      cell apoptosis and the protective role of exendin-4, a long-acting agonist of the 
      hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor. The glucose-sensitive mouse 
      β-pancreatic cell line, βTC6, was used to investigate the mechanisms of PA-induced 
      apoptosis. Our results showed that ERp46 expression was reduced in a dose- and 
      time-dependent manner after PA treatment. Furthermore, inhibition of ERp46 
      expression by small interfering (si)RNA-mediated silencing enhanced the ER stress 
      response via three separate pathways and increased βTC6 cell apoptosis rates. 
      Moreover, exendin-4 reduced the ER stress response and levels of apoptosis in NC 
      transfected cells after PA treatment, but not in cells transfected with ERp46siRNA. 
      In conclusion, ERp46 plays a protective role in PA-induced cell apoptosis by 
      decreasing the ER stress response and might be a novel target for anti-diabetic 
      drugs. Exendin-4 might protect against βTC6 cell lipoapoptosis in part by activating 
      ERp46 signaling pathway.

TI  - Functional interconnectivity between the globus pallidus and the subthalamic nucleus 
      in the mouse brain slice.
PG  - 977-87
AB  - In accordance with its central role in basal ganglia circuitry, changes in the rate 
      of action potential firing and pattern of activity in the globus pallidus 
      (GP)-subthalamic nucleus (STN) network are apparent in movement disorders. In this 
      study we have developed a mouse brain slice preparation that maintains the 
      functional connectivity between the GP and STN in order to assess its role in 
      shaping and modulating bursting activity promoted by pharmacological manipulations. 
      Fibre-tract tracing studies indicated that a parasagittal slice cut 20 deg to the 
      midline best preserved connectivity between the GP and the STN. IPSCs and EPSCs 
      elicited by electrical stimulation confirmed connectivity from GP to STN in 44/59 
      slices and from STN to GP in 22/33 slices, respectively. In control slices, 74/76 
      (97%) of STN cells fired tonically at a rate of 10.3 +/- 1.3 Hz. This rate and 
      pattern of single spiking activity was unaffected by bath application of the GABA(A) 
      antagonist picrotoxin (50 microM, n = 9) or the glutamate receptor antagonist 
      (6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2, 3-dione (CNQX) 10 microM, n = 8). Bursting activity 
      in STN neurones could be induced pharmacologically by application of NMDA alone (20 
      microm, 3/18 cells, 17%) but was more robust if NMDA was applied in conjunction with 
      apamin (20-100 nM, 34/77 cells, 44%). Once again, neither picrotoxin (50 microM, n = 
      5) nor CNQX (10 microM, n = 5) had any effect on the frequency or pattern of the STN 
      neurone activity while paired STN and GP recordings of tonic and bursting activity 
      show no evidence of coherent activity. Thus, in a mouse brain slice preparation 
      where functional GP-STN connectivity is preserved, no regenerative synaptically 
      mediated activity indicative of a dynamic network is evident, either in the resting 
      state or when neuronal bursting in both the GP and STN is generated by application 
      of NMDA/apamin. This difference from the brain in Parkinson's disease may be 
      attributed either to insufficient preservation of cortico-striato-pallidal or 
      cortico-subthalamic circuitry, and/or an essential requirement for adaptive changes 
      resulting from dopamine depletion for the expression of network activity within this 
      tissue complex.

TI  - Impaired feedforward inhibition of the thalamocortical projection in epileptic Ca2+ 
      channel mutant mice, tottering.
PG  - 3056-65
AB  - The tottering (tg) mice have a mutation in the CaV2.1 (P/Q-type) voltage-dependent 
      Ca2+ channel alpha(1)2.1 subunit gene. tg mice show not only cerebellar ataxia but 
      also absence epilepsy, which begins at approximately 3 weeks of age and persists 
      throughout life. Similarities in EEG and sensitivity to antiepileptic drugs suggest 
      that tg mice are a good model for human absence epilepsy. Although imbalance between 
      excitatory and inhibitory activity in the thalamocortical network is thought to 
      contribute to the pathogenesis of absence epilepsy, the effect of the mutation on 
      thalamocortical synaptic responses remains unknown. Here we showed imbalanced 
      impairment of inhibitory synaptic responses in tg mice using brain slice 
      preparations. Somatosensory thalamocortical projection makes not only monosynaptic 
      glutamatergic connections but also disynaptic GABAergic connections, which mediate 
      feedforward inhibition, onto layer IV neurons. In tg mice, IPSC amplitudes recorded 
      from layer IV pyramidal cells of the somatosensory cortex in response to thalamic 
      stimulation became disproportionately reduced compared with EPSC amplitudes at later 
      developmental stages (postnatal days 21-30). Similar results were obtained by local 
      stimulation of layer IV pyramidal neurons. However, IPSC reduction was not seen in 
      layer V pyramidal neurons of epileptic tg mice or in layer IV pyramidal neurons of 
      younger tg mice before the onset of epilepsy (postnatal days 14-16). These results 
      showed that the feedforward inhibition from the thalamus to layer IV neurons of the 
      somatosensory cortex was severely impaired in tg mice and that the impairment of the 
      inhibitory synaptic transmission was correlated to the onset of absence epilepsy.

TI  - Venomous snakebites in an urban area: what are the possibilities?
PG  - 168-71
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the number of different species of venomous snakes privately 
      kept in a large urban area. METHODS: An anonymous survey of potential snake owners 
      in the Philadelphia urban and suburban area. The survey was mailed to members of the 
      Philadelphia Herpetological Society. In addition, the survey was published in 2 
      herpetological newsletters and online in the Herpetology Network. RESULTS: One 
      hundred sixty responses were obtained during a 6-month period. Ownership of 74 
      different varieties of venomous snakes was reported. Antivenin was not locally 
      available for 13 of these species. CONCLUSION: A wide variety of venomous captive 
      snakes can be found in the private sector. The potential for having to treat an 
      envenomation requires the emergency physician to maintain an education of snakebite 
      management options, including the various antivenin options available in their 
      geographical location.

TI  - Cytochemical analysis of acid phosphatase activity in the venom secretory cells of 
      Bothrops jararaca.
PG  - 311-7
AB  - A study of the histochemical reaction for acid phosphatase (AcPase) in venom gland 
      secretory cells from Bothrops jararaca was done to investigate the distribution of 
      lysosomes and related structures in stages of high- and low-protein synthesis. From 
      this analysis, it was expected to gain insight into the cellular pathway by which 
      AcPase is secreted into the venom. Two subtypes of AcPase reactivities were detected 
      in the venom gland secretory cells: one was found in lysosomes and related 
      structures and in some trans-Golgi network (TGN) elements and reacts with 
      beta-glycerophosphate (betaGP) as substrate; the other was found in secretory 
      vesicles, apical plasmalemma, lysosomes and related structures, and in some TGN 
      elements, and reacts with cytidine monophosphate (CMP). The results are compatible 
      with the possibility that there is a secretory via for AcPase in the venom gland of 
      B. jararaca and that the elements composing this pathway are noted only when CMP is 
      used as substrate. Large autophagosomes reactive to both betaGP and to CMP were 
      commonly observed in the basal region of the secretory cells, and they were more 
      abundant in the glands during the stage of low activity of protein synthesis.

TI  - K(Ca)3.1 channels facilitate K+ secretion or Na+ absorption depending on apical or 
      basolateral P2Y receptor stimulation.
PG  - 3483-94
LID - 10.1113/jphysiol.2011.207548 [doi]
AB  - Human mammary epithelial (HME) cells express several P2Y receptor subtypes located 
      in both apical and basolateral membranes. Apical UTP or ATP-γ-S stimulation of 
      monolayers mounted in Ussing chambers evoked a rapid, but transient decrease in 
      short circuit current (I(sc)), consistent with activation of an apical K+ 
      conductance. In contrast, basolateral P2Y receptor stimulation activated basolateral 
      K+ channels and increased transepithelial Na+ absorption. Chelating intracellular 
      Ca2+ using the membrane-permeable compound BAPTA-AM, abolished the effects of 
      purinoceptor activation on I(sc). Apical pretreatment with charybdotoxin also 
      blocked the I(sc) decrease by >90% and similar magnitudes of inhibition were 
      observed with clotrimazole and TRAM-34. In contrast, iberiotoxin and apamin did not 
      block the effects of apical P2Y receptor stimulation. Silencing the expression of 
      K(Ca)3.1 produced ∼70% inhibition of mRNA expression and a similar reduction in the 
      effects of apical purinoceptor agonists on I(sc). In addition, silencing P2Y2 
      receptors reduced the level of P2Y2 mRNA by 75% and blocked the effects of ATP-γ-S 
      by 65%. These results suggest that P2Y2 receptors mediate the effects of 
      purinoceptor agonists on K+ secretion by regulating the activity of K(Ca)3.1 
      channels expressed in the apical membrane of HME cells. The results also indicate 
      that release of ATP or UTP across the apical or basolateral membrane elicits 
      qualitatively different effects on ion transport that may ultimately determine the 
      [Na+]/[K+] composition of fluid within the mammary ductal network.

TI  - Bombesin potentiates taurocholic acid-induced neurotensin release in rats.
PG  - 2853-7
AB  - The hypothesis of synergistic effects between luminal stimulants and the intramural 
      neural network in the control of intestinal neurotensin (NT) release was 
      investigated with an isolated vascularly perfused rat jejuno-ileum. Luminal 
      administration of low doses of taurocholic acid (TC; 1, 5, and 10 mM) provoked only 
      a small increase in NT-like immunoreactivity (NT-LI) in the portal effluent (50%, 
      100%, and 130%, respectively, above basal). Increasing the concentration of TC to 20 
      mM induced a strong and sustained release of NT-LI (700% above basal). The arterial 
      infusion of bombesin (BOM; 10(-9) M) induced only a transient rise in NT-LI levels 
      (200% above basal), with a rapid return to basal values. In contrast, 10(-9) M BOM 
      synergistically enhanced NT-LI responses induced by 10 mM TC; the integrated 
      response of NT-LI release was 3.2-fold higher than the sum of responses to 10(-9) M 
      BOM and 10 mM TC alone. These cooperative effects were apparent with 10(-10) M BOM 
      and TC concentrations over the physiological range 1-10 mM. Neither tetrodotoxin 
      (10(-6) M) nor atropine (10(-5) M) was able to modify this synergy. Substance-P and 
      methacholine, two other NT secretagogues, did not potentiate the TC-induced NT 
      responses. In conclusion, BOM potentiated the release of NT induced by TC, thus 
      suggesting that bombesinergic neurons, among other stimulatory neurons of the 
      enteric nervous system, may modulate the sensitivity of N-cells to luminal 
      stimulants.

TI  - Toluene can perturb the neuronal voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels involved in the 
      middle-ear reflex.
PG  - 473-81
LID - 10.1093/toxsci/kfn242 [doi]
AB  - Numerous laboratory-based data have shown the ability of toluene (Tol) to exacerbate 
      noise-induced hearing loss. However, the mechanism responsible for the synergistic 
      effects of a coexposure to noise and Tol has not yet been completely elucidated. 
      Recent investigations in rats have focused on quantifying the anticholinergic 
      effects of certain aromatic solvents and have demonstrated that these solvents can 
      cancel the protective role played by the middle-ear reflex (MER). Voltage-dependent 
      Ca(2+) channels (VDCCs) regulate acetylcholine release in the central synaptic 
      network and control muscular excitation/contraction processes as well. In order to 
      identify the prevailing action of Tol in the central or peripheral compartment of 
      the MER arc, two VDCC antagonists were injected into the common carotid trunk: 
      omega-conotoxin MVIIC, which blocks only the neuronal N- and P/Q-type Ca(2+) 
      channels, or verapamil, which inhibits the muscular L-type Ca(2+) channels. Rats 
      were also implanted with an electrode on the round window membrane to measure the 
      cochlear microphonic potential (CMP) elicited with a band noise centered at 4 kHz 
      and emitted at 85 dB sound pressure level. The variations in CMP recorded during the 
      test compound injection showed that Tol has similar effects to those induced by 
      omega-conotoxin, the neuronal VDCC blocker. The response obtained with the verapamil 
      injection was broader than those obtained with Tol or conotoxin. This investigation 
      therefore revealed that Tol can mimic the effects of VDCC blockers. The antagonist 
      effects of Tol would be closer to neuronal than to muscular blockers and would be 
      presumably located at the level of the integrator centers of the reflex.

      neurons.
PG  - 168-77
AB  - Yessotoxin (YTX) and its analogues are disulphated polyether compounds of increasing 
      occurrence in seafood. The biological effects of these algal toxins on mammals and 
      the risk associated to their ingestion have not been clearly established. We have 
      used primary cultures of rat cerebellar neurons to investigate whether YTX affected 
      survival and functioning of central nervous system neurons. Exposure to YTX (> or 
      =25 nM) caused first (approximately 8 h) weakening, granulation, and fragmentation 
      of neuronal network, and later (approximately 48 h) complete disintegration of 
      neurites and extensive neuronal death, with a significant decrease in the amount of 
      filamentous actin. The concentration of YTX that reduced by 50% the maximum neuronal 
      survival (EC50(48)) was approximately 20 nM. Lower toxin concentrations 
      (approximately 15 nM) also caused visible signs of toxicity affecting neuronal 
      network primarily. Removal of YTX after 5 h exposure delayed the onset of 
      neurotoxicity but did not prevent neuronal degeneration and death. YTX induced a 
      two-fold increase in cytosolic calcium that was prevented by the voltage-sensitive 
      calcium channel antagonists nifedipine and verapamil. These antagonists were, 
      however, completely ineffective in reducing neurotoxicity. Voltage-sensitive sodium 
      channel antagonists saxitoxin and nefopam, and the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 
      also failed to prevent YTX neurotoxicity. Neuronal death by YTX involved typical 
      hallmarks of apoptosis and required the synthesis of new proteins. Our data suggest 
      neuronal tissue to be a vulnerable biological target for YTX. The potent 
      neurotoxicity of YTX we report raises reasonable concern about the potential risk 
      that exposure to YTX may represent for neuronal survival in vivo.

TI  - Kinetics of internalization and degradation of N-type voltage-gated calcium 
      channels: role of the alpha2/delta subunit.
PG  - 27-40
AB  - The contribution of voltage-gated calcium channels to excitable cell function 
      depends, critically, upon the mechanisms that control their expression at the cell 
      surface. While co-assembly of the pore forming alpha(1) and auxiliary beta subunits 
      enhances channel surface expression, the levels are still only 30-40% of those seen 
      with the core alpha(1B)/beta(1b)/alpha(2)delta calcium channel complex. To 
      rationalize this observation, it has been suggested that the alpha(2)/delta subunit 
      might stabilize calcium channel expression at the cell surface. To test this notion, 
      we have resolved the effect of the alpha(2)/delta subunit on the rates of binding, 
      internalization and degradation of defined N-type calcium channel surface complexes 
      expressed in HEK293 cells, through pulse-labeling with the selective, cell 
      impermeable, radioligand [(125)I]-omega-CgTx. Through detailed kinetic and 
      sensitivity analysis we show that alpha(1B)/beta(1b)/alpha(2)delta complexes are 
      internalized slowly (k(int) 0.4/h), whereupon, most become degraded (k(deg) 0.02/h). 
      In contrast, alpha(1B)/beta(1b) complexes are internalized more rapidly (k(int) 
      0.8/h), following which they are either quickly degraded (k(deg) 0.1/h) or are 
      sequestered slowly (k(tra) 0.1/h) to a pool that is metabolically stable within the 
      time-frame of our experiments (24h). In neither case did we find evidence for 
      recycling via the cell surface. Thus, our data argue for a novel mechanism where 
      complexes lacking an alpha(2)/delta subunit are cleared from the cell surface and 
      are rapidly degraded or stored, possibly for further attempts at complexation as new 
      alpha(2)/delta subunits become available. The slower rate of internalization of 
      complexes containing the alpha(2)/delta subunit rationalizes the stabilizing effect 
      this subunit has upon calcium channel surface expression and suggests a mechanism by 
      which alpha(2)delta mutations may cause severe neurological deficits.

TI  - Structural determinants of selective alpha-conotoxin binding to a nicotinic 
      acetylcholine receptor homolog AChBP.
PG  - 3615-20
AB  - The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is the prototype member of the 
      superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. How the extracellular 
      ligand-binding domain coordinates selective binding of ligand molecules to different 
      subtypes of the receptor is unknown at the structural level. Here, we present the 
      2.2-A crystal structure of a homolog of the ligand-binding domain of the nAChR, 
      Aplysia californica AChBP (Ac-AChBP), in complex with alpha-conotoxin ImI. This 
      conotoxin is unique in its selectivity toward the neuronal alpha3beta2 and alpha7 
      nAChR, a feature that is reflected in its selective binding to Ac-AChBP compared 
      with other AChBP homologs. We observe a network of interactions between the residues 
      of the ligand-binding site and the toxin, in which ImI Arg-7 and Trp-10 play a key 
      role. The toxin also forms interactions in the ligand-binding site that were not 
      seen in the complex of Ac-AChBP with PnIA(A10L D14K), a conotoxin variant that lacks 
      binding selectivity to AChBP homologs. In combination with electrophysiological 
      recordings obtained by using the wild-type alpha7 nAChR and L247T mutant, we show 
      that conotoxin ImI inhibits ion conduction by stabilizing the receptor in a 
      desensitized conformation. Comparison of the Ac-AChBP-ImI crystal structure with 
      existing AChBP structures offers structural insight into the extent of flexibility 
      of the interface loops and how their movement may couple ligand binding to channel 
      gating in the context of a nAChR.

TI  - Cilengitide combined with cetuximab and platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line 
      treatment in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients: results of an 
      open-label, randomized, controlled phase II study (CERTO).
PG  - 1734-40
LID - 10.1093/annonc/mdv219 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This multicentre, open-label, randomized, controlled phase II study 
      evaluated cilengitide in combination with cetuximab and platinum-based chemotherapy, 
      compared with cetuximab and chemotherapy alone, as first-line treatment of patients 
      with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients 
      were randomized 1:1:1 to receive cetuximab plus platinum-based chemotherapy alone 
      (control), or combined with cilengitide 2000 mg 1×/week i.v. (CIL-once) or 2×/week 
      i.v. (CIL-twice). A protocol amendment limited enrolment to patients with epidermal 
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) histoscore ≥200 and closed the CIL-twice arm for 
      practical feasibility issues. Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS; 
      independent read); secondary end points included overall survival (OS), safety, and 
      biomarker analyses. A comparison between the CIL-once and control arms is reported, 
      both for the total cohorts, as well as for patients with EGFR histoscore ≥200. 
      RESULTS: There were 85 patients in the CIL-once group and 84 in the control group. 
      The PFS (independent read) was 6.2 versus 5.0 months for CIL-once versus control 
      [hazard ratio (HR) 0.72; P = 0.085]; for patients with EGFR histoscore ≥200, PFS was 
      6.8 versus 5.6 months, respectively (HR 0.57; P = 0.0446). Median OS was 13.6 for 
      CIL-once versus 9.7 months for control (HR 0.81; P = 0.265). In patients with EGFR 
      ≥200, OS was 13.2 versus 11.8 months, respectively (HR 0.95; P = 0.855). No major 
      differences in adverse events between CIL-once and control were reported; nausea 
      (59% versus 56%, respectively) and neutropenia (54% versus 46%, respectively) were 
      the most frequent. There was no increased incidence of thromboembolic events or 
      haemorrhage in cilengitide-treated patients. αvβ3 and αvβ5 expression was neither a 
      predictive nor a prognostic indicator. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of cilengitide to 
      cetuximab/chemotherapy indicated potential clinical activity, with a trend for PFS 
      difference in the independent-read analysis. However, the observed inconsistencies 
      across end points suggest additional investigations are required to substantiate a 
      potential role of other integrin inhibitors in NSCLC treatment. CLINICAL TRIAL

TI  - Action potential modulation in CA1 pyramidal neuron axons facilitates OLM 
      interneuron activation in recurrent inhibitory microcircuits of rat hippocampus.
PG  - e113124

LID - e113124
AB  - Oriens-lacunosum moleculare (O-LM) interneurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus 
      play a key role in feedback inhibition and in the control of network activity. 
      However, how these cells are efficiently activated in the network remains unclear. 
      To address this question, I performed recordings from CA1 pyramidal neuron axons, 
      the presynaptic fibers that provide feedback innervation of these interneurons. Two 
      forms of axonal action potential (AP) modulation were identified. First, repetitive 
      stimulation resulted in activity-dependent AP broadening. Broadening showed fast 
      onset, with marked changes in AP shape following a single AP. Second, tonic 
      depolarization in CA1 pyramidal neuron somata induced AP broadening in the axon, and 
      depolarization-induced broadening summated with activity-dependent broadening. 
      Outside-out patch recordings from CA1 pyramidal neuron axons revealed a high density 
      of α-dendrotoxin (α-DTX)-sensitive, inactivating K+ channels, suggesting that K+ 
      channel inactivation mechanistically contributes to AP broadening. To examine the 
      functional consequences of axonal AP modulation for synaptic transmission, I 
      performed paired recordings between synaptically connected CA1 pyramidal neurons and 
      O-LM interneurons. CA1 pyramidal neuron-O-LM interneuron excitatory postsynaptic 
      currents (EPSCs) showed facilitation during both repetitive stimulation and tonic 
      depolarization of the presynaptic neuron. Both effects were mimicked and occluded by 
      α-DTX, suggesting that they were mediated by K+ channel inactivation. Therefore, 
      axonal AP modulation can greatly facilitate the activation of O-LM interneurons. In 
      conclusion, modulation of AP shape in CA1 pyramidal neuron axons substantially 
      enhances the efficacy of principal neuron-interneuron synapses, promoting the

AB  - ω-Agatoxin-IVA is a well known P/Q-type Ca(2+) channel blocker and has been shown to 
      affect presynaptic Ca(2+) currents as well postsynaptic potentials. P/Q-type voltage 
      gated Ca(2+) channels play a vital role in presynaptic neurotransmitter release and 
      thus play a role in action potential generation. Monitoring spontaneous activity of 
      neuronal networks on microelectrode arrays (MEAs) provides an important tool for 
      examining this neurotoxin. Changes in extracellular action potentials are readily 
      observed and are dependent on synaptic function. Given the efficacy of murine 
      frontal cortex and spinal cord networks to detect neuroactive substances, we 
      investigated the effects of ω-agatoxin on spontaneous action potential firing within 
      these networks. We found that networks derived from spinal cord are more sensitive 
      to the toxin than those from frontal cortex; a concentration of only 10nM produced 
      statistically significant effects on activity from spinal cord networks whereas 50 
      nM was required to alter activity in frontal cortex networks. Furthermore, the 
      effects of the toxin on frontal cortex are more complex as unit specific responses 
      were observed. These manifested as either a decrease or increase in action potential 
      firing rate which could be statistically separated as unique clusters. 
      Administration of bicuculline, a GABAA inhibitor, isolated a single response to 
      ω-agatoxin, which was characterized by a reduction in network activity. These data 
      support the notion that the two clusters detected with ω-agatoxin exposure represent 
      differential responses from excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations.

TI  - Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes involved in facilitation of GABAergic 
      inhibition in mouse superficial superior colliculus.
PG  - 3893-902
AB  - The superficial superior colliculus (sSC) is a key station in the sensory processing 
      related to visual salience. The sSC receives cholinergic projections from the 
      parabigeminal nucleus, and previous studies have revealed the presence of several 
      different nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits in the sSC. In this 
      study, to clarify the role of the cholinergic inputs to the sSC, we examined current 
      responses induced by ACh in GABAergic and non-GABAergic sSC neurons using in vitro 
      slice preparations obtained from glutamate decarboxylase 67-green fluorescent 
      protein (GFP) knock-in mice in which GFP is specifically expressed in GABAergic 
      neurons. Brief air pressure application of acetylcholine (ACh) elicited nicotinic 
      inward current responses in both GABAergic and non-GABAergic neurons. The inward 
      current responses in the GABAergic neurons were highly sensitive to a selective 
      antagonist for alpha3beta2- and alpha6beta2-containing receptors, alpha-conotoxin 
      MII (alphaCtxMII). A subset of these neurons exhibited a faster 
      alpha-bungarotoxin-sensitive inward current component, indicating the expression of 
      alpha7-containing nAChRs. We also found that the activation of presynaptic nAChRs 
      induced release of GABA, which elicited a burst of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic 
      currents mediated by GABA(A) receptors in non-GABAergic neurons. This ACh-induced 
      GABA release was mediated mainly by alphaCtxMII-sensitive nAChRs and resulted from 
      the activation of voltage-dependent calcium channels. Morphological analysis 
      revealed that recorded GFP-positive neurons are interneurons and GFP-negative 
      neurons include projection neurons. These findings suggest that nAChRs are involved 
      in the regulation of GABAergic inhibition and modulate visual processing in the sSC.

AB  - Drosophila clock neurons are self-sustaining cellular oscillators that rely on 
      negative transcriptional feedback to keep circadian time. Proper regulation of 
      organismal rhythms of physiology and behavior requires coordination of the 
      oscillations of individual clock neurons within the circadian control network. Over 
      the last decade, it has become clear that a key mechanism for intercellular 
      communication in the circadian network is signaling between a subset of clock 
      neurons that secrete the neuropeptide pigment dispersing factor (PDF) and clock 
      neurons that possess its G protein-coupled receptor (PDFR). Furthermore, the 
      specific hypothesis has been proposed that PDF-secreting clock neurons entrain the 
      phase of organismal rhythms, and the cellular oscillations of other clock neurons, 
      via the temporal patterning of secreted PDF signals. In order to test this 
      hypothesis, we have devised a novel technique for altering the phase relationship 
      between circadian transcriptional feedback oscillation and PDF secretion by using an 
      ion channel-directed spider toxin to modify voltage-gated Na(+) channel inactivation 
      in vivo. This technique relies on the previously reported "tethered-toxin" 
      technology for cell-autonomous modulation of ionic conductances via heterologous 
      expression of subtype-specific peptide ion channel toxins as chimeric fusion 
      proteins tethered to the plasma membrane with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) 
      anchor. We demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, the utility of the 
      tethered-toxin technology in a transgenic animal, validating four different tethered 
      spider toxin ion channel modifiers for use in Drosophila. Focusing on one of these 
      toxins, we show that GPI-tethered Australian funnel-web spider toxin delta-ACTX-Hv1a 
      inhibits Drosophila para voltage-gated Na(+) channel inactivation when coexpressed 
      in Xenopus oocytes. Transgenic expression of membrane-tethered delta-ACTX-Hv1a in 
      vivo in the PDF-secreting subset of clock neurons induces rhythmic action potential 
      bursts and depolarized plateau potentials. These in vitro and in vivo 
      electrophysiological effects of membrane-tethered delta-ACTX-Hv1a are consistent 
      with the effects of soluble delta-ACTX-Hv1a purified from venom on Na(+) channel 
      physiological and biophysical properties in cockroach neurons. Membrane-tethered 
      delta-ACTX-Hv1a expression in the PDF-secreting subset of clock neurons induces an 
      approximately 4-h phase advance of the rhythm of PDF accumulation in their terminals 
      relative to both the phase of the day:night cycle and the phase of the circadian 
      transcriptional feedback loops. As a consequence, the morning anticipatory peak of 
      locomotor activity preceding dawn, which has been shown to be driven by the clocks 
      of the PDF-secreting subset of clock neurons, phase advances coordinately with the 
      phase of the PDF rhythm of the PDF-secreting clock neurons, rather than maintaining 
      its phase relationship with the day:night cycle and circadian transcriptional 
      feedback loops. These results (1) validate the tethered-toxin technology for 
      cell-autonomous modulation of ion channel biophysical properties in vivo in 
      transgenic Drosophila, (2) demonstrate that the kinetics of para Na(+) channel 
      inactivation is a key parameter for determining the phase relationship between 
      circadian transcriptional feedback oscillation and PDF secretion, and (3) provide 
      experimental support for the hypothesis that PDF-secreting clock neurons entrain the 
      phase of organismal rhythms via the temporal patterning of secreted PDF signals.

TI  - Beta-scorpion toxin effects suggest electrostatic interactions in domain II of 
      voltage-dependent sodium channels.
PG  - 13-30
AB  - Beta-scorpion toxins specifically modulate the voltage dependence of sodium channel 
      activation by acting through a voltage-sensor trapping model. We used mutagenesis, 
      functional analysis and the action of beta-toxin as tools to investigate the 
      existence and role in channel activation of molecular interactions between the 
      charged residues of the S2, S3 and S4 segments in domain II of sodium channels. 
      Mutating to arginine the acidic residues of the S2 and S3 transmembrane segments in 
      domain II, or making charge-reversal mutation of the two outermost gating charges of 
      the IIS4 voltage sensor, shifts the voltage dependence of channel activation to more 
      positive potentials and enhances the effect of beta-scorpion toxin. Thus, mutations 
      of acidic residues in IIS2 and IIS3 segments are able to promote voltage-sensor 
      trapping in a way that is similar to the mutations of the arginines in the IIS4 
      segment. In order to disclose the network of interactions among acidic and basic 
      residues we performed functional analysis of charge-inversion double mutants: our 
      data suggest that the first arginine of the voltage sensor S4 in domain II (R850) 
      interacts specifically with E805, D814 and E821 in the S2 and S3 segments, whereas 
      the second arginine (R853) only interacts with D827 in the S3 segment. Our results 
      suggest that the S2, S3 and S4 segments in domain II form a voltage-sensing 
      structure, and that molecular interactions between the charged residues of this 
      structure modulate the availability of the IIS4 voltage sensor for trapping by 
      beta-toxins. They also provide unique insights into the molecular events that occur 
      during channel activation, as well as into the structure of the channel.

      mouse model of Rett syndrome during anoxia.
PG  - 300-15
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2010.08.031 [doi]
AB  - Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) deficiency causes Rett syndrome (RTT), a 
      neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe cognitive impairment, synaptic 
      dysfunction, and hyperexcitability. Previously we reported that the hippocampus of 
      MeCP2-deficient mice (Mecp2(-/y)), a mouse model for RTT, is more susceptible to 
      hypoxia. To identify the underlying mechanisms we now focused on the anoxic 
      responses of wildtype (WT) and Mecp2(-/y) CA1 neurons in acute hippocampal slices. 
      Intracellular recordings revealed that Mecp2(-/y) neurons show only reduced or no 
      hyperpolarizations early during cyanide-induced anoxia, suggesting potassium channel 
      (K(+) channel) dysfunction. Blocking adenosine-5'-triphosphate-sensitive K(+) 
      channels (K(ATP-)) and big-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels (BK-channels) 
      did not affect the early anoxic hyperpolarization in either genotype. However, 
      blocking Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum almost abolished the anoxic 
      hyperpolarizations in Mecp2(-/y) neurons. Single-channel recordings confirmed that 
      neither K(ATP)- nor BK-channels are the sole mediators of the early anoxic 
      hyperpolarization. Instead, anoxia Ca(2+)-dependently activated various 
      small/intermediate-conductance K(+) channels in WT neurons, which was less evident 
      in Mecp2(-/y) neurons. Yet, pharmacologically increasing the Ca(2+) sensitivity of 
      small/intermediate-conductance K(Ca) channels fully restored the anoxic 
      hyperpolarization in Mecp2(-/y) neurons. Furthermore, Ca(2+) imaging unveiled lower 
      intracellular Ca(2+) levels in resting Mecp2(-/y) neurons and reduced anoxic Ca(2+) 
      transients with diminished Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores. In conclusion, 
      the enhanced hypoxia susceptibility of Mecp2(-/y) hippocampus is primarily 
      associated with disturbed Ca(2+) homeostasis and diminished Ca(2+) rises during 
      anoxia. This secondarily attenuates the activation of K(Ca) channels and thereby 
      increases the hypoxia susceptibility of Mecp2(-/y) neuronal networks. Since 
      cytosolic Ca(2+) levels also determine neuronal excitability and synaptic 
      plasticity, Ca(2+) homeostasis may constitute a promising target for pharmacotherapy 
      in RTT.

TI  - Proximity-Based Emergency Response Communities for Patients With Allergies Who Are 
      at Risk of Anaphylaxis: Clustering Analysis and Scenario-Based Survey Study.
PG  - e13414
LID - 10.2196/13414 [doi]
LID - e13414
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anaphylaxis is a potentially fatal allergic reaction. However, many 
      patients at risk of anaphylaxis who should permanently carry a life-saving 
      epinephrine auto injector (EAI) do not carry one at the moment of allergen exposure. 
      The proximity-based emergency response communities (ERC) strategy suggests speeding 
      EAI delivery by alerting patient-peers carrying EAI to respond and give their EAI to 
      a nearby patient in need. OBJECTIVES: This study had two objectives: (1) to analyze 
      10,000 anaphylactic events from the European Anaphylaxis Registry (EAR) by elicitor 
      and location in order to determine typical anaphylactic scenarios and (2) to 
      identify patients' behavioral and spatial factors influencing their response to ERC 
      emergency requests through a scenario-based survey. METHODS: Data were collected and 
      analyzed in two phases: (1) clustering 10,000 EAR records by elicitor and incident 
      location and (2) conducting a two-center scenario-based survey of adults and parents 
      of minors with severe allergy who were prescribed EAI, in Israel and Germany. Each 
      group received a four-part survey that examined the effect of two behavioral 
      constructs-shared identity and diffusion of responsibility-and two spatial 
      factors-emergency time and emergency location-in addition to sociodemographic data. 
      We performed descriptive, linear correlation, analysis of variance, and t tests to 
      identify patients' decision factors in responding to ERC alerts. RESULTS: A total of 
      53.1% of EAR cases were triggered by food at patients' home, and 46.9% of them were 
      triggered by venom at parks. Further, 126 Israeli and 121 German participants 
      completed the survey and met the inclusion criteria. Of the Israeli participants, 
      80% were parents of minor patients with a risk of anaphylaxis due to food allergy; 
      their mean age was 32 years, and 67% were women. In addition, 20% were adult 
      patients with a mean age of 21 years, and 48% were female. Among the German 
      patients, 121 were adults, with an average age of 47 years, and 63% were women. In 
      addition, 21% were allergic to food, 75% were allergic to venom, and 2% had drug 
      allergies. The overall willingness to respond to ERC events was high. Shared 
      identity and the willingness to respond were positively correlated (r=0.51, P<.001) 
      in the parent group. Parents had a stronger sense of shared identity than adult 
      patients (t(243)= -9.077, P<.001). The bystander effect decreased the willingness of 
      all patients, except the parent group, to respond (F(1,269)=28.27, P<.001). An 
      interaction between location and time of emergency (F(1,473)=77.304, P<.001) 
      revealed lower levels of willingness to respond in strange locations during 
      nighttime. CONCLUSIONS: An ERC allergy app has the potential to improve outcomes in 
      case of anaphylactic events, but this is dependent on patient-peers' willingness to 
      respond. Through a two-stage process, our study identified the behavioral and 
      spatial factors that could influence the willingness to respond, providing a basis 
      for future research of proximity-based mental health communities.

AB  - Excellent results regarding improved therapeutic properties have been often obtained 
      through the conversion of a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) into a noncovalent 
      dimeric antibody (diabody) via peptide linker shortening. We utilized this approach 
      to obtain a dimeric version of the human scFv 6009F, which was originally engineered 
      to neutralize the Cn2 toxin of Centruroides noxius scorpion venom. However, some 
      envenoming symptoms remained with diabody 6009F. Diabody 6009F was subjected to 
      directed evolution to obtain a variant capable of eliminating envenoming symptoms. 
      After two rounds of biopanning, diabody D4 was isolated. It exhibited a single 
      mutation (E43G) in framework 2 of the heavy-chain variable domain. Diabody D4 
      displayed an increase in T(m) (thermal transition midpoint temperature) of 6.3°C 
      compared with its dimeric precursor. The importance of the E43G mutation was tested 
      in the context of the human scFv LR, a highly efficient antibody against Cn2, which 
      was previously generated by our group [Riaño-Umbarila, L., Contreras-Ferrat, G., 
      Olamendi-Portugal, T., Morelos-Juárez, C., Corzo, G., Possani, L. D. and Becerril, 
      B. (2011). J. Biol. Chem.286, 6143-6151]. The new variant, scFv LER, displayed an 
      increase in T(m) of 3.4°C and was capable of neutralizing 2 LD(50) of Cn2 toxin with 
      no detectable symptoms when injected into mice at a 1:1 toxin-to-antibody molar 
      ratio. These results showed that the E43G mutation might increase the therapeutic 
      properties of these antibody fragments. Molecular modeling and dynamics results 
      suggest that the rearrangement of the hydrogen-bonding network near the E43G 
      mutation could explain the improved functional stability and neutralization 
      properties of both the diabody D4 and scFv LER.

TI  - The short-term cost-effectiveness of once-daily liraglutide versus once-weekly 
      exenatide for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the United States.
PG  - e0121915
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0121915 [doi]
LID - e0121915
AB  - BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disease with 
      substantial morbidity, mortality, and economic impacts. Glucagon-like peptide-1 
      (GLP-1) receptor agonists, such as once-daily (QD) liraglutide and once-weekly (QW) 
      exenatide, are FDA-approved treatment for T2DM. Head-to-head trials and 
      meta-analyses comparing these agents have reported clinically meaningful 
      improvements but small differences in glycemic control between both agents. In this 
      study, we calculate and compare the cost-effectiveness implications of these 
      alternative effectiveness outcomes. METHODS: We developed a decision model to 
      evaluate the short-term cost-effectiveness of exenatide QW 2 mg versus liraglutide 
      QD 1.8 mg in T2DM patients, with effectiveness measured as reduction in glycated 
      hemoglobin (HbA1c). In the base case, the model tracks change in HbA1c and direct 
      medical expenditure over a 6-month time horizon. We calculated and compared the cost 
      per 1% reduction in HbA1c of models populated with clinical data from a head-to-head 
      randomized, controlled trial (DURATION-6) and a network meta-analysis. Expenditure 
      inputs were derived from wholesale acquisition costs and published sources. RESULTS: 
      In the base case, 6-month expenditure for the liraglutide and exenatide strategies 
      were $3,509 and $2,618, respectively. Using clinical data from DURATION-6 and the 
      network meta-analysis, the liraglutide strategy had an incremental cost per 1% 
      reduction in HbA1c of $4,773 and $27,179, respectively. The most influential model 
      parameters were drug costs, magnitude of HbA1c reduction in patients on treatment 
      for >1 month, and liraglutide gastrointestinal adverse event rate. In probabilistic 
      sensitivity analyses (PSA) using DURATION-6 data, the exenatide strategy was optimal 
      at willingness-to-pay levels below $4,800 per 1% reduction in HbA1c. In a PSA using 
      meta-analysis data, the exenatide strategy was dominant. CONCLUSIONS: Our modeled 
      results demonstrate that the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of liraglutide QD 
      1.8 mg relative to exenatide QW 2 mg depend largely on the chosen source of the 
      clinical data.

TI  - Leptin resistance and enhancement of feeding facilitation by melanin-concentrating 
      hormone in mice lacking bombesin receptor subtype-3.
PG  - 570-6
AB  - Mice lacking either bombesin receptor subtype (BRS)-3 or gastrin-releasing peptide 
      receptor (GRP-R) exhibit feeding abnormalities. However, it is unclear how these 
      receptors are associated with feeding regulation. In BRS-3-deficient mice, we found 
      hyperphagia, subsequent hyperleptinemia, and brain leptin resistance that occurred 
      after the onset of obesity. To explore the cause of this phenomenon, we examined 
      changes in feeding responses to appetite-related neuropeptides in BRS-3-deficient, 
      GRP-R-deficient, and wild-type littermate mice. Among orexigenic neuropeptides, the 
      hyperphagic response to melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) was significantly 
      enhanced in BRS-3-deficient mice but not in GRP-R-deficient mice. In addition, the 
      levels of MCH-R and prepro-MCH mRNAs in the hypothalamus of BRS-3-deficient mice 
      were significantly more elevated than those of wild-type littermates. There was no 
      significant difference in feeding between BRS-3-deficient and wild-type littermate 
      mice after treatment with bombesin (BN), although the hypophagic response to 
      low-dose BN was significantly suppressed in the GRP-R-deficient mice. These results 
      suggest that upregulation of MCH-R and MCH triggers hyperphagia in BRS-3-deficient 
      mice. From these results, we assume that the BRS-3 gene deletion upsets the 
      mechanism by which leptin decreases the expression of MCH-R and that this effect may 
      be mediated through neural networks independent of BN-related peptides such as 
      GRP-R.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness analysis of exenatide once-weekly versus dulaglutide, 
      liraglutide, and lixisenatide for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus: an 
      analysis from the UK NHS perspective.
PG  - 1127-1134
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of exenatide 2 mg once-weekly (EQW) 
      compared to dulaglutide 1.5 mg QW, liraglutide 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg once-daily (QD), 
      and lixisenatide 20 μg QD for the treatment of adult patients with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (T2DM) not adequately controlled on metformin. METHODS: The Cardiff 
      Diabetes Model was applied to evaluate cost-effectiveness, with treatment effects 
      sourced from a network meta-analysis. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were 
      calculated with health-state utilities applied to T2DM-related complications, weight 
      changes, hypoglycemia, and nausea. Costs (GBP £) included drug treatment, 
      T2DM-related complications, severe hypoglycemia, nausea, and treatment 
      discontinuation due to adverse events. A 40-year time horizon was used. RESULTS: In 
      all base-case comparisons, EQW was associated with a QALY gain per patient; 0.046 vs 
      dulaglutide 1.5 mg; 0.102 vs liraglutide 1.2 mg; 0.043 vs liraglutide 1.8 mg; and 
      0.074 vs lixisenatide 20 μg. Cost per patient was lower for EQW than for liraglutide 
      1.8 mg (-£2,085); therefore, EQW dominated liraglutide 1.8 mg. The cost difference 
      per patient between EQW and dulaglutide 1.5 mg, EQW and liraglutide 1.2 mg, and EQW 
      and lixisenatide 20 μg was £27, £103, and £738, respectively. Cost per QALY gained 
      with EQW vs dulaglutide 1.5 mg, EQW vs liraglutide 1.2 mg, and EQW vs lixisenatide 
      20 μg was £596, £1,004, and £10,002, respectively. In the probabilistic sensitivity 
      analysis, the probability that EQW is cost-effective ranged from 76-99%. CONCLUSION: 
      Results suggest that exenatide 2 mg once-weekly is cost-effective over a lifetime 
      horizon compared to dulaglutide 1.5 mg QW, liraglutide 1.2 mg QD, liraglutide 1.8 mg 
      QD, and lixisenatide 20 μg QD for the treatment of T2DM in adults not adequately 
      controlled on metformin alone.

TI  - Interpreting the structural mechanism of action for MT7 and human muscarinic

AB  - MT7 is a selective human muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 1 (hM1) allosteric binder 
      with subnanomolar affinity. Understanding the binding mode of hM1-MT7 will give 
      insights to discover small molecular ligand for hM1. MT7 is a peptide, and hM1 is a 
      G-protein-coupled membrane receptor. Therefore, we have employed homology modeling, 
      protein-protein docking, explicit membrane molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and 
      molecular mechanic/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area energy decomposition analysis 
      approaches to reveal the hM1-MT7 binding mode. The binding mode is consistent with 
      the experimental data. We have discovered that the binding mode consists of three 
      interaction regions in five residue interaction clusters. By analyzing the cluster 
      representative structures, the cluster residues form an interaction network, which 
      shows a multiple-point-to-site binding mode. Hydrogen binding statistical analysis 
      reveals that E170 (hM1) and R34 (MT7) are both locked in electrostatic cages with 
      counter charges, respectively. This is confirmed by the dynamic distances 
      calculation between these residues, and biological mutant experiments.

AB  - The study aimed to describe severe and fatal cases of box jellyfish stings in 
      Thailand. Medical records were reviewed and patients, relatives, health staffs, and 
      witnesses were interviewed. The pictures of suspected box jellyfish were sent via 
      e-mail to experts in the toxic jellyfish network for further identification. There 
      were at least 8 cases of box jellyfish envenomation, with 4 fatal and 4 near-fatal 
      cases. There were an equal number of male and female patients from 4 to 26 years of 
      age. In each case, there was immediate severe pain followed by systemic reactions. 
      Immediately after exposure to the sting, 7 victims collapsed experiencing severe 
      pain at the tentacle marks, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest. All patients 
      had tentacle marks on their bodies. In none of the fatal cases was vinegar applied 
      to the tentacle marks as first aid, but 3 out of the 4 near-fatal cases were treated 
      with a vinegar application.

TI  - Synthesis and characterization of a cyclooctapeptide analogue of ω-agatoxin IVB 
      enhancing the activity of Cav2.1 calcium channels activity in cultured hippocampal 
      neurons.

AB  - The structure of the toxin ω-agatoxin IVB, extracted from the venom of funnel-web 
      spider Agelenopsis aperta, is an important lead structure when considering the 
      design of modulators of synaptic transmission which largely involves P/Q-type 
      (CaV2.1) voltage gated calcium channels (VGCC) at central synapses. Focusing on the 
      loop 2 of the ω-agatoxin IVB that seems to be the most preeminent interacting domain 
      of the toxin with the CaV2.1 VGCC, cyclooctapeptides mimicking this loop were 
      synthesized. While (14)Trp is essential for the binding of the neurotoxin to the 
      CaV2.1 VGCC, the substitution of the (12)Cys for a glycidyl residue led to a 
      cyclooctapeptide named EP14 able to enhance CaV2.1 VGCC-associated currents measured 
      with patch-clamp recordings and to evoke ω-agatoxin IVA-sensitive intracellular 
      Ca(2+) increase as measured by fura-2 spectrofluoroimaging. Furthermore, this 
      cyclooctapeptide was able to potentiate spontaneous excitatory synaptic transmission 
      in a network of cultured hippocampal neurons, consistent with the activation of 
      presynaptic VGCC by EP14. In addition, this peptide did not affect cell survival 
      measured with the MTT assay. Therefore, such new cyclopeptidic structures are 
      potential good candidates for synthesis of new agents aimed at the restoration 
      deficient excitatory synaptic transmission.

AB  - Microglia rapidly respond to CNS injury and disease and can assume a spectrum of 
      activation states. While changes in gene expression and production of inflammatory 
      mediators have been extensively described after classical (LPS-induced) and 
      alternative (IL4-induced) microglial activation, less is known about acquired 
      de-activation in response to IL10. It is important to understand how microglial 
      activation states affect their migration and invasion; crucial functions after 
      injury and in the developing CNS. We reported that LPS-treated rat microglia migrate 
      very poorly, while IL4-treated cells migrate and invade much better. Having 
      discovered that the lamellum of migrating microglia contains a large ring of 
      podosomes--microscopic structures that are thought to mediate adhesion, migration 
      and invasion--we hypothesized that IL4 and IL10 would differentially affect podosome 
      expression, gene induction, migration and invasion. Further, based on the enrichment 
      of the KCa2.3/SK3 Ca2+-activated potassium channel in microglial podosomes, we 
      predicted that it regulates migration and invasion. We found both similarities and 
      differences in gene induction by IL4 and IL10 and, while both cytokines increased 
      migration and invasion, only IL10 affected podosome expression. KCa2.3 currents were 
      recorded in microglia under all three activation conditions and KCNN3 (KCa2.3) 
      expression was similar. Surprisingly then, of three KCa2.3 inhibitors (apamin, 
      tamapin, NS8593), only NS8593 abrogated the increased migration and invasion of IL4 
      and IL10-treated microglia (and invasion of unstimulated microglia). This 
      discrepancy was explained by the observed block of TRPM7 currents in microglia by 
      NS8593, which occurred under all three activation conditions. A similar inhibition 
      of both migration and invasion was seen with a TRPM7 inhibitor (AA-861) that does 
      not block KCa2.3 channels. Thus, we conclude that TRPM7 (not KCa2.3) contributes to 
      the enhanced ability of microglia to migrate and invade when in anti-inflammatory 
      states. This will be an important consideration in developing TRPM7 inhibitors for 
      treating CNS injury.

AB  - Oscillation activities are the feature of neural network and correlated to different 
      physiological states. The theta (θ) oscillation (2-7 Hz) has been reported in the 
      basal ganglia, and the intrinsic resonance properties of individual neurons have 
      provided a basis for this network oscillation. The basal ganglia neurons receive 
      comprehensive modulation arising from dopaminergic (DA) neurons located in the 
      substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), but how the oscillation is regulated in SNc DA 
      neurons remains poorly understood. In this paper, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings 
      were performed on SNc DA neurons in rat brain slices to reveal the resonance 
      properties and underlying mechanisms. After swept-sine-wave (ZAP protocol) current 
      was injected into SNc DA neurons, θ resonance was induced, whose peak impedance went 
      up with the rising of temperature, demonstrating the dependency of resonance on 
      temperature. Voltage dependency of resonance was also observed at hyperpolarized 
      membrane potentials. Further investigation demonstrated two individual components: 
      (1) SK-current generated resonance at around -65 mV, which could be blocked by 
      apamin (300 nM), a specific antagonist of the small-conductance calcium-dependent 
      potassium channel; (2) h-current (I (h)) generated resonance at around -75 mV, which 
      could be abolished by ZD7288 (10 μM), a selective blocker of HCN channels. We 
      concluded that in SNc DA neurons, θ resonance was mediated by two distinct ionic 
      channels at hyperpolarized potentials. Our results imply that θ frequency resonance 
      of individual SNc DA neurons may participate in coordinating rhythmic firing 
      activity and contribute to the physiological or pathophysiological behaviors of 
      Parkinson's disease.

TI  - Postnatal development of temporal integration, spike timing and spike threshold 
      regulation by a dendrotoxin-sensitive K⁺ current in rat CA1 hippocampal cells.
PG  - 12-23
LID - 10.1111/ejn.12385 [doi]
AB  - Spike timing and network synchronization are important for plasticity, development 
      and maturation of brain circuits. Spike delays and timing can be strongly modulated 
      by a low-threshold, slowly inactivating, voltage-gated potassium current called 
      D-current (ID ). ID can delay the onset of spiking, cause temporal integration of 
      multiple inputs, and regulate spike threshold and network synchrony. Recent data 
      indicate that ID can also undergo activity-dependent, homeostatic regulation. 
      Therefore, we have studied the postnatal development of ID -dependent mechanisms in 
      CA1 pyramidal cells in hippocampal slices from young rats (P7-27), using somatic 
      whole-cell recordings. At P21-27, these neurons showed long spike delays and 
      pronounced temporal integration in response to a series of brief depolarizing 
      current pulses or a single long pulse, whereas younger cells (P7-20) showed shorter 
      discharge delays and weak temporal integration, although the spike threshold became 
      increasingly negative with maturation. Application of α-dendrotoxin (α-DTX), which 
      blocks ID , reduced the spiking latency and temporal integration most strongly in 
      mature cells, while shifting the spike threshold most strongly in a depolarizing 
      direction in these cells. Voltage-clamp analysis revealed an α-DTX-sensitive outward 
      current (ID ) that increased in amplitude during development. In contrast to P21-23, 
      ID in the youngest group (P7-9) showed smaller peri-threshold amplitude. This may 
      explain why long discharge delays and robust temporal integration only appear later, 
      3 weeks postnatally. We conclude that ID properties and ID -dependent functions 
      develop postnatally in rat CA1 pyramidal cells, and ID may modulate network activity 
      and plasticity through its effects on synaptic integration, spike threshold, timing 
      and synchrony.

TI  - Solution structure and backbone dynamics of an omega-conotoxin precursor.
PG  - 538-50
AB  - Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to characterize the solution 
      structure and backbone dynamics of a putative precursor form of omega-conotoxin 
      MVIIA, a 25-amino-acid residue peptide antagonist of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels. 
      The mature peptide is found in the venom of a fish-hunting marine snail Conus magus 
      and contains an amidated carboxyl terminus that is generated by oxidative cleavage 
      of a Gly residue. The form examined in this study is identical to the mature peptide 
      except for the presence of the unmodified carboxy-terminal Gly. This form, referred 
      to as omega-MVIIA-Gly, has previously been shown to refold and form its disulfides 
      more efficiently than the mature form, suggesting that the presence of the terminal 
      Gly may favor folding in vivo. The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure 
      determination indicated that the fold of omega-MVIIA-Gly is very similar to that 
      previously determined for the mature form, but revealed that the terminal Gly 
      residue participates in a network of hydrogen bonds involving both backbone and side 
      chain atoms, very likely accounting for the enhanced stability and folding 
      efficiency. (15)N relaxation experiments indicated that the backbone is well ordered 
      on the nanosecond time scale but that residues 9-15 undergo a conformational 
      exchange processes with a time constant of approximately 35 microseconds. Other 
      studies have implicated this segment in the binding of the peptide to its 
      physiological target, and the observed motions may play a role in allowing the 
      peptide to enter the binding site

TI  - A novel predictive technique for the MHC class II peptide-binding interaction.
PG  - 220-5
AB  - Antigenic peptide is presented to a T-cell receptor through the formation of a 
      stable complex with a Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecule. Various 
      predictive algorithms have been developed to estimate a peptide's capacity to form a 
      stable complex with a given MHC Class II allele, a technique integral to the 
      strategy of vaccine design. These have previously incorporated such computational 
      techniques as quantitative matrices and neural networks. We have developed a novel 
      predictive technique that uses molecular modeling of predetermined crystal 
      structures to estimate the stability of an MHC Class II peptide complex. This is the 
      1st structure-based technique, as previous methods have been based on binding data. 
      ROC curves are used to quantify the accuracy of the molecular modeling technique. 
      The novel predictive technique is found to be comparable with the best predictive 
      software currently available.

TI  - The Ca2+ activated SK3 channel is expressed in microglia in the rat striatum and 
      contributes to microglia-mediated neurotoxicity in vitro.
PG  - 4
LID - 10.1186/1742-2094-7-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Small-conductance Ca2+ activated K+ channels are expressed in the CNS, 
      where KCNN2/SK2/KCa2.2 and KCNN3/SK3/KCa2.3 help shape the electrical activity of 
      some neurons. The SK3 channel is considered a potential therapeutic target for 
      diseases and disorders involving neuron hyper-excitability but little is known about 
      its expression and roles in non-neuronal cells in either the healthy or damaged CNS. 
      The purpose of this study was to examine expression of KCNN3/SK3 in CNS microglia in 
      vivo and in vitro, and to use an established in vitro model to determine if this 
      channel contributes to the neurotoxic capacity of activated microglia. METHODS: 
      KCNN3 mRNA (real-time RT-PCR) and SK3 immunoreactivity were examined in rat 
      microglia. Lipopolysaccharide was then used to activate microglia (monitored by 
      iNOS, nitric oxide, activation of NF-kappaB and p38 MAPK) and transform them to a 
      neurotoxic state. Microglia-mediated neuron damage (TUNEL, activated caspase 3) and 
      nitrotyrosine levels were quantified using a two-chamber system that allowed 
      microglia to be treated with channel blockers, washed and then added to 
      neuron/astrocyte cultures. Contributions of SK3 to these processes were 
      discriminated using a subtractive pharmacological approach with apamin and tamapin. 
      ANOVA and post-hoc tests were used to assess the statistical significance of 
      differences between treatment groups. SK3 immunoreactivity was then compared in the 
      normal and damaged adult rat striatum, by injecting collagenase (a hemorrhagic 
      stroke) or endothelin-1 (a transient ischemic stroke). RESULTS: KCNN3 mRNA was 
      prevalent in cultured microglia and increased after lipopolysaccharide-induced 
      activation; SK3 channel blockade inhibited microglial activation and reduced their 
      ability to kill neurons. SK3 immunoreactivity was prevalent in cultured microglia 
      and throughout the adult rat striatum (except white matter tracts). After strokes, 
      SK3 was highly expressed in activated microglia/macrophages within the lesions, but 
      reduced in other cells. CONCLUSIONS: SK3 is expressed in microglia in both the 
      healthy and damaged adult striatum, and mechanistic in vitro studies show it 
      contributes to transformation of microglia to an activated neurotoxic phenotype. 
      Thus, SK3 might be a therapeutic target for reducing inflammation-mediated acute CNS 
      damage. Moreover, its roles in microglia must be considered when targeting this 
      channel for CNS diseases, disorders and reducing neuron hyper-excitability.

      human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells: cross talk among the UPR, c-Jun and ROS.

AB  - Pardaxin, an antimicrobial peptide secreted by the Red Sea flatfish Pardachirus 
      marmoratus, inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of human cancer cell lines. 
      However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are only partially understood at 
      present. In this study, we used proteomic approaches and network reconstruction to 
      clarify the mechanism of pardaxin-induced apoptosis in human cervical carcinoma HeLa 
      cells. We identified that pardaxin-regulated proteins predominantly function in the 
      unfolded protein response, oxidative stress and cytoskeletal distribution. Molecular 
      examination of signal transduction and cellular localization demonstrated that the 
      activator protein-1 transcription factor was activated, which eventually caused 
      apoptosis via both caspase- and apoptosis-inducing factor-dependent pathways. 
      Scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) alleviated c-Jun activation, and small 
      interfering RNA knockdown of c-Jun abrogated pardaxin-induced caspase activation and 
      cell death, thereby implicating ROS and c-Jun in pardaxin-induced apoptosis 
      signaling. In summary, this study provides the first protein-interacting network 
      maps and novel insights into the biological responses and potential toxicity of 
      pardaxin.

TI  - Single particle tracking of alpha7 nicotinic AChR in hippocampal neurons reveals 
      regulated confinement at glutamatergic and GABAergic perisynaptic sites.
PG  - e11507
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0011507 [doi]

AB  - Alpha7 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (alpha7-nAChR) form 
      Ca(2+)-permeable homopentameric channels modulating cortical network activity and 
      cognitive processing. They are located pre- and postsynaptically and are highly 
      abundant in hippocampal GABAergic interneurons. It is unclear how alpha7-nAChRs are 
      positioned in specific membrane microdomains, particularly in cultured neurons which 
      are devoid of cholinergic synapses. To address this issue, we monitored by single 
      particle tracking the lateral mobility of individual alpha7-nAChRs labeled with 
      alpha-bungarotoxin linked to quantum dots in live rat cultured hippocampal 
      interneurons. Quantitative analysis revealed different modes of lateral diffusion of 
      alpha7-nAChR dependent on their subcellular localization. Confined receptors were 
      found in the immediate vicinity of glutamatergic and GABAergic postsynaptic 
      densities, as well as in extrasynaptic clusters of alpha-bungarotoxin labeling on 
      dendrites. alpha7-nAChRs avoided entering postsynaptic densities, but exhibited 
      reduced mobility and long dwell times at perisynaptic locations, indicative of 
      regulated confinement. Their diffusion coefficient was lower, on average, at 
      glutamatergic than at GABAergic perisynaptic sites, suggesting differential, 
      synapse-specific tethering mechanisms. Disruption of the cytoskeleton affected 
      alpha7-nAChR mobility and cell surface expression, but not their ability to form 
      clusters. Finally, using tetrodotoxin to silence network activity, as well as 
      exposure to a selective alpha7-nAChR agonist or antagonist, we observed that 
      alpha7-nAChRs cell surface dynamics is modulated by chronic changes in neuronal 
      activity. Altogether, given their high Ca(2+)-permeability, our results suggest a 
      possible role of alpha7-nAChR on interneurons for activating Ca(2+)-dependent 
      signaling in the vicinity of GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses.

TI  - Metabolic cholesterol depletion hinders cell-surface trafficking of the nicotinic 
      acetylcholine receptor.
PG  - 239-49
AB  - The effects of metabolic inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis on the trafficking 
      of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) to the cell membrane were studied in 
      living CHO-K1/A5, a Chinese hamster ovary clonal line that heterologously expresses 
      adult alpha2betadeltaepsilon mouse AChR. To this end, we submitted CHO-K1/A5 cells 
      to long-term cholesterol deprivation, elicited by Mevinolin, a potent inhibitor of 
      3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase and applied a combination of biochemical, 
      pharmacological and fluorescence microscopy techniques to follow the fate of the 
      AChR. When CHO-K1/A5 cells were grown for 48 h in lipid-deficient medium 
      supplemented with 0.5 microM Mevinolin, total cholesterol was significantly reduced 
      (40%). Concomitantly, the maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) of the cell-surface 
      AChR for the competitive antagonist alpha-bungarotoxin was reduced from 647+/-30 to 
      352+/-34 fmol/mg protein, i.e. by 46%. The apparent dissociation constant (Kdapp) 
      for alpha-bungarotoxin of the AChRs remaining at the cell surface was not modified 
      by cholesterol depletion. Similarly, the half-concentration inhibiting the specific 
      binding of the radioligand (IC50) for another competitive antagonist, 
      d-tubocurarine, did not differ from that in control cells. The decrease in 
      cell-surface AChR was paralleled by an increase in intracellular AChR levels, which 
      rose from 44+/-2.1% in control cells to 74+/-3.3% in Mevinolin-treated cells. When 
      analyzed by wide-field fluorescence microscopy, the fluorescence signal arising from 
      alpha-bungarotoxin labeled cell-surface AChRs was reduced by approximately 70% in 
      Mevinolin-treated cells. The distribution of intracellular AChR also changed: 
      Alexa594-alpha-bungarotoxin-labeled AChR exhibited a highly compartmentalized 
      pattern, concentrating at the perinuclear and Golgi-like regions. Temperature-arrest 
      of protein trafficking magnified this effect, emphasizing the Golgi localization of 
      the AChR. Colocalization studies using the transiently expressed fluorescent 
      trans-Golgi/trans-Golgi network marker pEYFP/human beta1,4-galactosyltransferase and 
      the trans-Golgi network marker syntaxin 6 provided additional support for the Golgi 
      localization of intracellular AChRs. The low AChR cell-surface expression and the 
      increase in intracellular AChR pools in cholesterol-depleted cells raise the 
      possibility that cholesterol participates in the trafficking of the receptor protein 
      to the plasmalemma and its stability at this surface location.

TI  - Comparison of safety and tolerability with continuous (exenatide once weekly) or 
      intermittent (exenatide twice daily) GLP-1 receptor agonism in patients with type 2 
      diabetes.
PG  - 1097-103

AB  - AIMS: Exenatide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist shown to improve 
      glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Intermittent exenatide 
      exposure is achieved with the twice-daily formulation (ExBID), while the once-weekly 
      formulation (ExQW) provides continuous exenatide exposure. This integrated, 
      retrospective analysis compared safety and tolerability of ExQW vs. ExBID in 
      patients with T2DM. METHODS: Data were pooled from two open-label, randomized, 
      comparator-controlled, trials directly comparing ExQW (N = 277) to ExBID (N = 268). 
      Between-group differences in adverse event (AE) and hypoglycaemia incidences were 
      calculated. Incidence over time and duration of selected AEs (nausea, vomiting, and 
      injection-site-related AEs) were also summarized. RESULTS: The most common AEs were 
      nausea, diarrhoea, injection-site pruritus, and vomiting. Nausea and vomiting 
      occurred less frequently with ExQW vs. ExBID, peaking at initiation (ExQW) or at 
      initiation and dose escalation (ExBID), and decreasing over time. Few patients 
      discontinued because of gastrointestinal-related AEs. Injection-site AEs were more 
      common with ExQW but decreased over time in both groups. No major hypoglycaemia 
      occurred; minor hypoglycaemia occurred with low incidence in patients not using 
      concomitant sulphonylurea, with no difference between ExQW and ExBID. Serious AEs 
      and discontinuations because of AEs were reported with similar frequency in both 
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both exenatide formulations were generally safe and 
      well-tolerated, with ExQW associated with less nausea and vomiting but more 
      injection-site AEs. Continuous vs. intermittent exposure did not impact the overall 
      tolerability profile of exenatide, with no evidence of prolonged duration or 
      worsened intensities of AEs with continuous exposure.

TI  - Nonaggressive systemic mastocytosis (SM) without skin lesions associated with 
      insect-induced anaphylaxis shows unique features versus other indolent SM.
PG  - 520-8

AB  - BACKGROUND: Indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM) without skin lesions (ISMs(-)) 
      shows a higher prevalence in males, lower serum baseline tryptase levels, and KIT 
      mutation more frequently restricted to bone marrow (BM) mast cells (MCs) than ISM 
      with skin lesions (ISMs(+)). Interestingly, in almost one-half of ISMs(-) patients, 
      MC-mediator release episodes are triggered exclusively by insects. OBJECTIVE: We 
      aimed to determine the clinical and laboratory features of ISMs(-) associated with 
      insect-induced anaphylaxis (insectISMs(-)) versus other patients with ISM. METHODS: 
      A total of 335 patients presenting with MC activation syndrome, including 143 
      insectISMs(-), 72 ISMs(-) triggered by other factors (otherISMs(-)), 56 ISMs(+), and 
      64 nonclonal MC activation syndrome, were studied. RESULTS: Compared with 
      otherISMs(-) and ISMs(+) patients, insectISMs(-) cases showed marked male 
      predominance (78% vs 53% and 46%; P < .001), a distinct pattern of MC-related 
      symptoms, and significantly lower median serum baseline tryptase levels (22.4 vs 
      28.7 and 45.8 μg/L; P ≤ .009). Moreover, insectISMs(-) less frequently presented BM 
      MC aggregates (46% vs 70% and 81%; P ≤ .001), and they systematically showed 
      MC-restricted KIT mutation. CONCLUSIONS: ISMs(-) patients with anaphylaxis triggered 
      exclusively by insects display clinical and laboratory features that are 
      significantly different from other ISM cases, including other ISMs(-) and ISMs(+) 
      patients, suggesting that they represent a unique subgroup of ISM with a 
      particularly low BM MC burden in the absence of adverse prognostic factors.

AB  - Engineering extracellular matrices that utilize the body's natural healing capacity 
      enable the progression of regenerative therapies. Fibrin, widely used as a surgical 
      sealant, is one such matrix that may be augmented by the addition of protein factors 
      to promote cell infiltration and differentiation. The thrombin-catalyzed conversion 
      of fibrinogen to fibrin exposes N-terminal fibrin knobs that bind to C-terminal 
      pockets to form the fibrin network. Here, we have created a platform system for the 
      production of therapeutic proteins that capitalize on these native knob:pocket 
      interactions for protein delivery within fibrin matrices. This system enables the 
      retention of therapeutic proteins within fibrin without additional enzymatic or 
      synthetic crosslinking factors. Using an integrin-binding fibronectin fragment as a 
      model protein, we demonstrate that engineered knob-protein fusions bind consistently 
      and specifically to fibrin(ogen). Equilibrium dissociation constants (K(D)) obtained 
      using surface plasmon resonance indicate that these fusions have mum binding 
      affinities, comparable to the native knob-containing fibrin fragments. The 
      specificity of these interactions was verified by ELISA in the presence of molar 
      excess of competing knob mimics. Release profiles and real-time confocal imaging 
      demonstrate that the fusions were retained within fibrin matrices, even under the 
      stringent continuous perfusion conditions used in the latter. In summary, this work 
      explores the benefits and limitations of engaging native, biologically-inspired, 
      non-covalent knob:pocket interactions within fibrin(ogen) for the retention of 
      therapeutic proteins in fibrin matrices and provides insight into the stability of 
      native knob:pocket interactions within fibrin networks.

TI  - 5-Hydroxytryptamine action in the rat olfactory bulb: in vitro electrophysiological 
      patch-clamp recordings of juxtaglomerular and mitral cells.
PG  - 717-31
AB  - The olfactory bulb, first relay of olfactory pathways, is densely innervated by 
      serotoninergic centrifugal fibers originating from the raphe nuclei. Although 
      serotonin innervation was reported to be involved in olfactory learning in mammals, 
      the action of this neurotransmitter on its putative cellular targets has been never 
      described through unitary recordings. This lack of data initiated the present study 
      where the effects of 5HT on juxtaglomerular and mitral cells are analyzed using 
      whole-cell recordings on olfactory bulb slices. Serotonin depolarizes 34% of 525 JG 
      cells. A multivariate statistical analysis of juxtaglomerular cells characteristics 
      shows that the serotonin responsive cell group can be individualized regarding their 
      tonic discharge-mode in response to a direct current injection, their lower 
      expression of hyperpolarization-activated cation current and their low membrane 
      capacities. The use of ion channel blockers and ramp voltage protocol indicate that 
      serotoninergic depolarization of juxtaglomerular cells may be due to a nonselective 
      cation current with a reversal potential of -44 mV. Pharmacological tests with 
      serotonin receptor antagonists and agonists reveal that 5HT action on 
      juxtaglomerular cells would be mainly mediated by 5HT2C receptors. In mitral cells, 
      serotonin acts on 49.1% of the 242 tested cells, inducing two types of responses. A 
      first subset of mitral cells (26.8%, n=65) were hyperpolarized by serotonin. This 
      response would be indirect and mediated by action of GABA on GABAA receptors since 
      it was antagonized by bicuculline. The involved GABAergic neurons are hypothesized 
      to be juxtaglomerular and granular cells, on which serotonin would act mainly via 
      5HT2C and via 5HT2A receptors respectively. The second subset of mitral cells 
      (22.3%, n=54) were directly depolarized by serotonin acting through 5HT2A receptors. 
      Our data on serotonin action on juxtaglomerular cells and mitral cells reveal a part 
      of functional mechanisms whereby serotonin can act on olfactory bulb network. This 
      is expected to enrich the understanding of its determining role in olfactory 
      learning.

TI  - Potassium and calcium channel dependence of bursting in cultured neuronal networks.
PG  - 310-8
AB  - Increases in extracellular potassium concentrations reliably increase burst rates in 
      cultured fetal murine spinal cord networks. This effect could be mimicked by either 
      blocking voltage-gated potassium conductances or facilitating excitatory synaptic 
      interactions, but not by blocking specific calcium-dependent potassium conductances 
      or tonic depolarization. Spontaneous bursting in cultured networks is apparently 
      dependent on potassium currents and intracellular calcium levels, but not on the 
      pharmacologically characterized calcium-dependent potassium conductances.

TI  - The structure of a native l-amino acid oxidase, the major component of the Vipera

      stabilization by divalent ions.
PG  - 379-84
LID - 10.1039/c0mb00101e [doi]
AB  - The crystal structure of the major component of the Vipera ammodytes ammodytes 
      venomic, a flavotoxin, member of the l-amino acid oxidase (LAAO) family, has been 
      determined and refined at 2.6 Å resolution. The asymmetric unit consists of four 
      molecules, each bound to oxidized FAD, representing a dimer of dimers. The binding 
      of four Zn(2+) ions stabilizes the enzymatically active quaternary structure and is 
      considered important for the biological activity of LAAO and other flavoproteins. 
      Each monomer consists of three domains with a cofactor bound between the FAD and 
      substrate binding domains, and a solvent exposed glycosylation site which is 
      considered crucial for the toxicity. Comparison of LAAO structures in the absence 
      and presence of a substrate indicates conformational changes in the dynamic active 
      site. The active site H-bond network involving the triad Lys326-Water-N5 of FAD is 
      formed only upon substrate binding, and results in the increased mobility of the 
      isoalloxazine system. Details of the catalytic transformation of amino acid 
      substrates are discussed.

TI  - A novel natural mutation AαPhe98Ile in the fibrinogen coiled-coil affects fibrinogen 
      function.

LID - 10.1160/TH13-04-0267 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the structure and function of fibrinogen 
      obtained from a patient with normal coagulation times and idiopathic thrombophilia. 
      This was done by SDS-PAGE and DNA sequence analyses, scanning electron microscopy, 
      fibrinopeptide release, fibrin polymerisation initiated by thrombin and reptilase, 
      fibrinolysis, and platelet aggregometry. A novel heterozygous point mutation in the 
      fibrinogen Aα chain, Phe98 to Ile, was found and designated as fibrinogen Vizovice. 
      The mutation, which is located in the RGDF sequence (Aα 95-98) of the fibrinogen 
      coiled-coil region, significantly affected fibrin clot morphology. Namely, the clot 
      formed by fibrinogen Vizovice contained thinner and curled fibrin fibers with 
      reduced length. Lysis of the clots prepared from Vizovice plasma and isolated 
      fibrinogen were found to be impaired. The lysis rate of Vizovice clots was almost 
      four times slower than the lysis rate of control clots. In the presence of platelets 
      agonists the mutant fibrinogen caused increased platelet aggregation. The data 
      obtained show that natural mutation of Phe98 to Ile in the fibrinogen Aα chain 
      influences lateral aggregation of fibrin protofibrils, fibrinolysis, and platelet 
      aggregation. They also suggest that delayed fibrinolysis, together with the abnormal 
      fibrin network morphology and increased platelet aggregation, may be the direct 
      cause of thrombotic complications in the patient associated with pregnancy loss.

TI  - Pharmacological effects of the marine toxins, brevetoxin and saxitoxin, on murine 
      frontal cortex neuronal networks.
PG  - 669-76
AB  - Brevetoxins and saxitoxins (STXs), which are produced by marine dinoflagellates, are 
      very potent neurotoxins targeting separate sites of the alpha subunit of 
      voltage-dependent sodium channels (VDSCs). An attractive approach for marine toxin 
      detection relies on pharmacological modulation of VDSCs expressed in cells or 
      tissues. While these function-based cellular assays exhibit the required 
      sensitivity, they are typically slow and have limited potential use for field 
      applications. Cultured neuronal networks grown on substrate integrated 
      microelectrode arrays (MEAs) have emerged as a robust and sensitive approach for 
      environmental threat detection. The present work describes the rapid effects of 
      brevetoxin-2 (PbTx-2) and STX on embryonic murine frontal cortex neuronal networks 
      on MEAs. Network recording parameters such as mean spike rate, burst rate, burst 
      duration, number of spikes per burst and spike amplitude were analyzed before and 
      after exposure to the toxins. STX produced fast and reversible inhibition of all 
      electrophysiological parameters with IC(50)s ranging between 1.2 and 2.2nM. Although 
      PbTx-2 also caused inhibition of most of the network electrophysiological 
      parameters, it produced an increase in burst duration at lower concentrations 
      (EC(50)=15+/-2 nM, n=4) followed by inhibition at higher ones (IC(50)=63+/-4 nM, 
      n=4). Exposure of frontal cortex networks to PbTx-2 and STX also caused differential 
      effects on spike amplitude. This work demonstrates that cultured neuronal networks 
      not only could be used for pharmacological characterization of marine toxins but 
      they also provide a tool with unique properties for their detection.

TI  - Effects of alpha-pompilidotoxin on synchronized firing in networks of rat cortical 
      neurons.
PG  - 49-52
AB  - We studied the effect of a novel neurotoxin, alpha-pompilidotoxin (alpha-PMTX) on 
      the spontaneously synchronized network firing of cultured rat cortical neurons. 
      Alpha-PMTX acted immediately and irreversibly to disrupt synchronous activity, 
      leaving only residual sparse, uncorrelated firing and was effective at 
      concentrations of 10 nM. In the presence of bicuculline to block inhibitory synaptic 
      transmission, the shutdown in synchronized activity occurred with a significant 
      delay, required a higher concentration of alpha-PMTX (> 100 nM), and was preceded by 
      a transiently increased level of firing. It appears that both inhibitory and 
      excitatory neuronal activity or synaptic transmission are amplified by alpha-PMTX, 
      but that intense activity eventually leads to inactivation or transmitter depletion.

TI  - Mathematical modelling of the enteric nervous network. II: Facilitation and 
      inhibition of the cholinergic transmission.
PG  - 311-8
AB  - The pharmacokinetic responses of the cholinergic enteric neurone to treatment with 
      acetylcholinesterases, tetrodotoxin, some chloride salts of divalent cations, 
      botulinum toxin, beta-bungarotoxin and changes in the concentration of calcium ions 
      in the external medium and repetitive stimulation are presented. The numerical 
      results obtained reproduce quantitatively the effects of toxins and salts of 
      divalent cations acting at different levels of acetylcholine release from the 
      nerve-terminal. The addition of cholinergic agonists potentiates the action of 
      acetylcholine and increases the amplitude of the generated excitatory postsynaptic 
      potential. A decrease in the concentration of extracellular Ca2+ ions reduces the 
      amplitude of the excitatory postsynaptic potential and significantly increases 
      synaptic transmission time. The effect of tetrodotoxin is the blockade propagation 
      of the action potential along the nerve axon and, as a consequence, acetylcholine 
      release from the vesicular store. All these effects have been shown to be 
      dose-dependent. The repetitive stimulation of the neurone reproduces the effects of 
      accumulation and potentiation. The possible applications of the model for the 
      analysis of the enteric nervous system function are discussed.

TI  - Apamin blocks the slow AHP in lamprey and delays termination of locomotor bursts.
PG  - 943-5
AB  - The effects of apamin on the slow afterhyperpolarization (sAHP) in spinal neurones 
      and on the frequency of rhythmic bursting during fictive locomotion were 
      investigated in the lamprey spinal cord in vitro. Apamin, which is a selective 
      blocker of a small conductance KCa channel responsible for the sAHP in many types of 
      neurones, was also found to reduce the sAHP in lamprey neurones. The summation of 
      the sAHP is considered to be an important burst terminating factor in the spinal 
      locomotor network and thereby to regulate the frequency of fictive locomotion. In 
      support of this view, apamin was found to reduce the frequency of rhythmic bursting 
      during fictive locomotion induced by kainate and NMDA. Serotonin, which has 
      previously been shown to reduce the sAHP and slow the rate of rhythmic bursting, may 
      therefore act, at least in part, on apamin-sensitive KCa channels.

PG  - 331-4
AB  - To get figures of prevalence of systemic reactions (SRs) to hymenoptera sting in 
      adults between the ages of 18 to 65 years, we performed three different surveys 
      using the same questionnaire from 1984 to 1988. The first one was a door-to-door 
      survey in Southeast France, which included 8271 adults and used a questionnaire. The 
      second one, which included 2067 adults, was performed in a health care center and 
      comprised the same questionnaire and venom skin tests in subjects reporting a 
      history of SRs. The third survey was a national poll performed through a home-based 
      national computer network. The percentage of SRs ranged from 0.66% in the second 
      survey including skin tests to 3.3% in the poll survey. The higher prevalence figure 
      in this latter survey may be related to a false-positive history. There was no 
      urban-rural difference in prevalence of SR.

TI  - Investigating the ultrastructure of platelets of HIV patients treated with the 
      immuno-regulator, Canova: a qualitative scanning electron microscopy study.
PG  - 399-405
LID - 10.14670/HH-24.399 [doi]
AB  - The resistance of HIV strains to the available antiretroviral medication has become 
      a major problem in the world today. This has forced researchers to investigate the 
      possible use of alternative drugs such as homeopathic medicine (e.g. 
      immunomodulators) to enhance the immune system of patients infected with HIV. Canova 
      is an immunomodulator of herbal origin which is known to stimulate the host defense 
      against several pathological states through the activation of the immune system. 
      Blood platelets play an important role in homeostasis, thrombosis and the immune 
      response by forming platelet aggregates. The ultrastructure of platelet aggregates 
      of patients with HIV has been studied previously using SEM to determine the effect 
      of HIV on the platelet morphology. Membrane blebbing and ruptured platelet membranes 
      were observed which is indicative of apoptosis, revealing that HIV patients may 
      develop thrombocytopenia as a result of peripheral platelet destruction. The aim of 
      the current study was to investigate the effect of HIV on the morphology of 
      platelets from patients treated with the immuno-modulator, Canova, compared to 
      control individuals and HIV patients not on the Canova treatment. Blood was drawn 
      from the individuals and the coagula were formed by adding human thrombin to the 
      platelet rich plasma. Examination was done using SEM. CD4 counts were also 
      determined. Slight morphological changes were seen when comparing the fibrin 
      networks from the control, untreated HIV patients and the Canova-treated HIV 
      patients, suggesting that HIV does not impact on the fragility of fibrin networks. 
      In HIV patients there are bleb-like bulges on the membrane of platelets as well as 
      membrane breakages visible on the aggregate, whereas in the Canova-treated patients 
      membrane blebbing is far less pronounced and there are large areas of intact, smooth 
      membranes with visible canalicular areas, suggesting that Canova protects the 
      membranes of platelets and that blebbing does not appear in such great proportions 
      as was found in the untreated HIV group. These results support and provide 
      ultrastructural evidence for the results seen in previous research, where it is seen 
      that Canova protects the immune system of immuno-compromised patients by keeping the 
      ultrastructure intact thereby preventing the devastating cyto-destructive effects of 
      HIV disease.

TI  - Enteric origin of bombesin immunoreactive fibres in the rat coeliac-superior 
      mesenteric ganglion.
PG  - 190-5
AB  - Bombesin-like immunoreactivity occurs in a dense network of nerve fibres in the rat 
      coeliac-superior mesenteric ganglion. No bombesin immunoreactive cell bodies have 
      been observed in this ganglion. An origin outside the ganglion was therefore assumed 
      for the bombesin immunoreactive fibres. Ligation of the mesenteric nerve, between 
      the ganglion and the gut resulted in an accumulation of bombesin immunoreactive 
      material on the distal side, i.e. towards the gut. Transection of the nerve caused a 
      depletion of bombesin immunoreactive fibres in the ganglion. These results suggest 
      that bombesin immunoreactive fibres in the coeliac-superior mesenteric ganglion of 
      the rat originate in neurons in the gastrointestinal wall. Application of colchicine 
      to the stomach wall caused an accumulation of bombesin immunoreactive material in 
      myenteric neurons.

TI  - Synaptic and intrinsic mechanisms shape synchronous oscillations in hippocampal 
      neurons in culture.
PG  - 389-97
AB  - We have detected spontaneous, synchronous calcium oscillations, associated with 
      variations in membrane potential, in hippocampal neurons maintained in primary 
      culture. The oscillatory activity is synaptically driven, as it is blocked by 
      tetrodotoxin, by the glutamate receptor antagonist 
      6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) and by toxins inhibiting 
      neurotransmitter release from presynaptic nerve endings. Neuronal oscillations do 
      not require for their expression the presence of a polyneuronal network and are not 
      primarily influenced by the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptor antagonist 
      picrotoxin, suggesting that they entirely rely on glutamatergic neurotransmission. 
      Synaptic and intrinsic conductances shape the synchronized oscillations in 
      hippocampal neurons. The concomitant activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) 
      receptors and voltage-activated L-type calcium channels allows calcium entering from 
      the extracellular medium and sustaining the long depolarization, which shapes every 
      single calcium wave.

TI  - Synthesis and conformational analysis of apamin analogues with natural and 
      non-natural cystine/selenocystine connectivities.
PG  - 550-64
AB  - By replacing two cysteine residues in apamin with selenocysteine, the three possible 
      isomers related to the side-chain connectivities of a bis-cystinyl-peptide were 
      synthesized in regioselective manner exploiting the low redox potential of the 
      diselenide bond. Nuclear magnetic resonance conformational analysis of 
      monoselenocystine analogue apamin with the natural diselenide/disulfide network 
      confirmed the highly isomorphous character of the sulfur replacement with selenium 
      despite its slightly larger atomic radius and increased bond lengths. The 
      comparative conformational analysis of the apamin analogues containing the 
      non-natural side-chain links with wild type apamin clearly revealed retention of the 
      main structural fold and thus the high propensity of these small molecules to adopt 
      the secondary structure elements present in natural apamin. These findings offered 
      interesting hints for a better understanding of the oxidative refolding pathway of 
      the bis-cystinyl peptide that leads exclusively to the correct natural isomer.

TI  - Recruitment of apical dendritic T-type Ca2+ channels by backpropagating spikes 
      underlies de novo intrinsic bursting in hippocampal epileptogenesis.
PG  - 435-50
AB  - A single episode of status epilepticus (SE) induced in rodents by the convulsant 
      pilocarpine, produces, after a latent period of > or = 2 weeks, a chronic epileptic 
      condition. During the latent period of epileptogenesis, most CA1 pyramidal cells 
      that normally fire in a regular pattern, acquire low-threshold bursting behaviour, 
      generating high-frequency clusters of 3-5 spikes as their minimal response to 
      depolarizing stimuli. Recruitment of a Ni(2+)- and amiloride-sensitive T-type Ca(2+) 
      current (I(CaT)), shown to be up-regulated after SE, plays a critical role in burst 
      generation in most cases. Several lines of evidence suggest that I(CaT) driving 
      bursting is located in the apical dendrites. Thus, bursting was suppressed by 
      focally applying Ni(2+) to the apical dendrites, but not to the soma. It was also 
      suppressed by applying either tetrodotoxin or the K(V)7/M-type K(+) channel agonist 
      retigabine to the apical dendrites. Severing the distal apical dendrites 
      approximately 150 microm from the pyramidal layer also abolished this activity. 
      Intradendritic recordings indicated that evoked bursts are associated with local 
      Ni(2+)-sensitive slow spikes. Blocking persistent Na(+) current did not modify 
      bursting in most cases. We conclude that SE-induced increase in I(CaT) density in 
      the apical dendrites facilitates their depolarization by the backpropagating somatic 
      spike. The I(CaT)-driven dendritic depolarization, in turn, spreads towards the 
      soma, initiating another backpropagating spike, and so forth, thereby creating a 
      spike burst. The early appearance and predominance of I(CaT)-driven low-threshold 
      bursting in CA1 pyramidal cells that experienced SE most probably contribute to the 
      emergence of abnormal network discharges and may also play a role in the circuitry 
      reorganization associated with epileptogenesis.

TI  - Restoration of enzymatic activity in a Ser-49 phospholipase A2 homologue decreases 
      its Ca(2+)-independent membrane-damaging activity and increases its toxicity.
PG  - 12795-809
AB  - Ammodytin L (AtnL) is a Ser-49 secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) homologue with 
      myotoxic activity. By analogy to the Lys-49 sPLA2 myotoxins, AtnL has been predicted 
      to be enzymatically inactive due to the absence of the conserved Asp-49 that 
      participates in coordination of the Ca2+ cofactor. By substituting Ser-49 and three 
      other residues in the Ca2+-binding loop of AtnL, we obtained the first two 
      enzymatically active mutants of Lys-49/Ser-49 sPLA2 homologues. The mutants LW and 
      LV, which differed only by the presence of Trp and Val at position 31, respectively, 
      efficiently hydrolyzed phospholipid vesicles, while recombinant AtnL displayed no 
      activity. In contrast to AtnL but similarly to ammodytoxin A (AtxA), a homologous 
      neurotoxic sPLA2, both mutants exhibited catalysis-dependent membrane-damaging 
      ability, involving vesicle contents leakage and fusion. However, LW and LV also 
      exhibited the potent, Ca2+-independent disruption of vesicle integrity 
      characteristic of AtnL, but not of AtxA, in which leakage of the contents is not 
      associated with membrane fusion. Although LV and, especially, LW have the advantage 
      over AtnL of being able to act in both Ca2+-independent and Ca2+-dependent modes, 
      and display higher cytotoxicity and higher lethal potency, they have a lower 
      Ca2+-independent membrane-damaging potency and display reduced specificity in 
      targeting muscle fibers in vitro. Our results indicate that, in evolution, Lys-49 
      and Ser-49 sPLA2 myotoxins have lost their Ca2+-binding ability and enzymatic 
      activity through subtle changes in the Ca2+-binding network without affecting the 
      rest of the catalytic machinery, thereby optimizing their Ca2+-independent 
      membrane-damaging ability and myotoxic activity.

TI  - Vascular endothelial growth factor enhances glomerular capillary repair and 
      accelerates resolution of experimentally induced glomerulonephritis.
PG  - 599-608
AB  - Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) regulates angiogenesis through endothelial 
      cell proliferation and plays an important role in capillary repair in damaged 
      glomeruli. We tested the hypothesis that VEGF might be beneficial in rats with 
      severe glomerular injury in glomerulonephritis (GN) based on its angiogenic and 
      vascular remodeling properties. Acute GN with severe glomerular destruction was 
      induced in rats by injection of anti-Thy-1.1 antibody (day 0) and Habu-snake venom 
      (day 1). Rats were intraperitoneally injected with recombinant human VEGF(165) (10 
      microg/100 g body wt/day) or vehicle from day 2 to day 9, and monitored changes in 
      glomerular capillaries, development of glomerular inflammation, and progression to 
      glomerular sclerosis after acute glomerular destruction in both groups. Rats that 
      received anti-Thy-1.1 antibody and Habu-snake venom showed severe mesangiolysis and 
      marked destruction of capillary network on day 2. VEGF was expressed on glomerular 
      epithelial cells, proliferating mesangial cells, and some infiltrating leukocytes, 
      and VEGF(165) protein levels increased in damaged glomeruli during day 5 to day 7. 
      Normal, damaged, and regenerating glomerular endothelial cells expressed VEGF 
      receptor flk-1. However, endothelial cell proliferation and capillary repair was 
      rare in vehicle-treated rats with severe glomerular damage, which progressed to 
      global sclerosis and chronic renal failure by week 8. In contrast, in the 
      VEGF-treated group, VEGF(165) significantly enhanced endothelial cell proliferation 
      and capillary repair in glomeruli by day 9 (proliferating endothelial cells: 
      VEGF(165), 4.3 +/- 1.1; control, 2.2 +/- 0.9 cells on day 7, P < 0.001; and 
      glomerular capillaries: VEGF(165), 24.6 +/- 4.8; control, 16.9 +/- 3.4 capillaries 
      on day 7, P < 0.01). Thereafter, damaged glomeruli gradually recovered after 
      development of capillary network by week 8, and significant improvement of renal 
      function was evident in the VEGF-treated group during week 8 (creatinine: VEGF(165), 
      0.3 +/- 0.1; control, 2.6 +/- 0.9 mg/dl, P < 0.001; proteinuria: VEGF(165), 54 +/- 
      15; control, 318 +/- 60 mg/day, P < 0.001). We conclude that the beneficial effect 
      of VEGF(165) in severe glomerular injury in GN emphasizes the importance of 
      capillary repair in the resolution of GN, and may allow the design of new 
      therapeutic strategies against severe GN.

TI  - The alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor: molecular modelling, electrostatics, 
      and energetics.
PG  - 151-62
AB  - The structure of a homopentameric alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is 
      modelled by combining structural information from two sources: the X-ray structure 
      of a water soluble acetylcholine binding protein from Lymnea stagnalis, and the 
      electron microscopy derived structure of the transmembrane domain of the Torpedo 
      nicotinic receptor. The alpha7 nicotinic receptor model is generated by 
      simultaneously optimising: (i) chain connectivity, (ii) avoidance of 
      stereochemically unfavourable contacts, and (iii) contact between the beta1-beta2 
      and M2-M3 loops that have been suggested to be involved in transmission of 
      conformational change between the extracellular and transmembrane domains. A 
      Gaussian network model was used to predict patterns of residue mobility in the 
      alpha7 model. The results of these calculations suggested a flexibility gradient 
      along the transmembrane domain, with the extracellular end of the domain more 
      flexible that the intracellular end. Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) energy calculations and 
      atomistic (molecular dynamics) simulations were used to estimate the free energy 
      profile of a Na+ ion as a function of position along the axis of the pore-lining M2 
      helix bundle of the transmembrane domain. Both types of calculation suggested a 
      significant energy barrier to exist in the centre of the (closed) pore, consistent 
      with a "hydrophobic gating" model. Estimations of the PB energy profile as a 
      function of ionic strength suggest a role of the extracellular domain in determining 
      the cation selectivity of the alpha7 nicotinic receptor. These studies illustrate 
      how molecular models of members of the nicotinic receptor superfamily of channels 
      may be used to study structure-function relationships.

TI  - The disulfide-coupled folding pathway of apamin as derived from diselenide-quenched 
      analogs and intermediates.
PG  - 1605-13
AB  - The sequence of apamin, an 18 residue bee venom toxin, encloses all the information 
      required for the correct disulfide-coupled folding into the cystine-stabilized 
      alpha-helical motif. Three apamin analogs, each containing a pair of selenocysteine 
      residues replacing the related cysteines, were synthesized to mimic the three 
      possible apamin isomers with two crossed, parallel, or consecutive disulfides, 
      respectively. Refolding experiments clearly revealed that the redox potential of 
      selenocysteine prevails over the sequence encoded structural information for proper 
      folding of apamin. Thus, selenocysteine can be used as a new device to generate 
      productive and nonproductive folding intermediates of peptides and proteins. In 
      fact, disulfides are selectively reduced in presence of the diselenide and the 
      conformational features derived from these intermediates as well as from the 
      three-dimensional (3D) structures of the selenocysteine-containing analogs with 
      their nonnatural networks of diselenide/disulfide bridges allowed to gain further 
      insight into the subtle driving forces for the correct folding of apamin that mainly 
      derive from local conformational preferences.

TI  - Crystal structures of the complexes of a group IIA phospholipase A2 with two natural 
      anti-inflammatory agents, anisic acid, and atropine reveal a similar mode of 
      binding.
PG  - 89-100
AB  - Secretory low molecular weight phospholipase A(2)s (PLA(2)s) are believed to be 
      involved in the release of arachidonic acid, a precursor for the biosynthesis of 
      pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. Therefore, the specific inhibitors of these enzymes 
      may act as potent anti-inflammatory agents. Similarly, the compounds with known 
      anti-inflammatory properties should act as specific inhibitors. Two plant compounds, 
      (a) anisic acid (4-methoxy benzoic acid) and (b) atropine (8-methyl-8-azabicyclo 
      oct-3-hydroxy-2-phenylpropanoate), have been used in various inflammatory disorders. 
      Both compounds (a) and (b) have been found to inhibit PLA(2) activity having binding 
      constants of 4.5 x 10(-5) M and 2.1 x 10(-8) M, respectively. A group IIA PLA(2) was 
      isolated and purified from the venom of Daboia russelli pulchella (DRP) and its 
      complexes were made with anisic acid and atropine. The crystal structures of the two 
      complexes (i) and (ii) of PLA(2) with compounds (a) and (b) have been determined at 
      1.3 and 1.2 A resolutions, respectively. The high-quality observed electron 
      densities for the two compounds allowed the accurate determinations of their atomic 
      positions. The structures revealed that these compounds bound to the enzyme at the 
      substrate - binding cleft and their positions were stabilized by networks of 
      hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. The most characteristic interactions 
      involving Asp 49 and His 48 were clearly observed in both complexes, although the 
      residues that formed hydrophobic interactions with these compounds were not 
      identical because their positions did not exactly superimpose in the large 
      substrate-binding hydrophobic channel. Owing to a relatively small size, the 
      structure of anisic acid did not alter upon binding to PLA(2), while that of 
      atropine changed significantly when compared with its native crystal structure. The 
      conformation of the protein also did not show notable changes upon the bindings of 
      these ligands. The mode of binding of anisic acid to the present group II PLA(2) is 
      almost identical to its binding with bovine pancreatic PLA(2) of group I. On the 
      other hand, the binding of atropine to PLA(2) is similar to that of another plant 
      alkaloid aristolochic acid.

TI  - Mucosal plexus and electrolyte transport across the rat colonic mucosa.
PG  - 531-42
AB  - Histological and functional studies were performed on a preparation of rat colonic 
      mucosa from which the myenteric and submucosal plexus were removed. This 
      preparation, referred to as the mucosa preparation, was used to investigate the 
      potential influence of the mucosal plexus on electrolyte transport. Two 
      neuropharmacologically active agents were used: sea anemone toxin (ATX II) to 
      stimulate the fibres of the mucosal plexus and tetrodotoxin (TTX) to block the 
      fibres of the mucosal plexus. The morphology of the neuronal network of the mucosal 
      plexus was visualized after the epithelium was removed and whole mount preparations 
      of the lamina propria and circular muscle layer of muscularis mucosae were stained 
      histochemically for acetylcholinesterase activity. Several levels of organization 
      within the mucosal plexus were seen. Each crypt is encircled by a thin bundle of 
      fibres near the top. These thin fibres connect with thicker bundles of fibres that 
      encircle groups of two to five crypts in a broad band. These bundles of fibres are 
      in turn connected to larger bundles of fibres which lie in a flat plane just below 
      the crypts along the circular muscle layer of muscularis mucosae. In addition 
      perikarya and ganglia were revealed within the mucosal plexus. The base-line net 
      transport of Na+ and Cl- across the mucosa preparation was completely inhibited by 
      ATX II (10(-6) M). This effect of ATX II on net Na+ and Cl- transport was 
      accompanied with an increase in the short-circuit current (Isc), transmural 
      conductance, and open-circuit potential difference across the mucosa preparation. 
      The effect of ATX II on Isc was dose dependent with a half-maximal effective 
      concentration at 5 X 10(-8) M-ATX II and a maximal effective concentration of 10(-7) 
      M. ATX II was effective only when added to the serosal solution. Net Na+ and Cl- 
      transport was restored by TTX (10(-6) M) to base-line values in ATX II-treated 
      tissue. In addition the value of all three electrical parameters rapidly returned to 
      the values measured before the addition of ATX II. TTX was effective in antagonizing 
      the effects of ATX II only when added to the serosal solution. The results suggest 
      that the regulation of electrolyte transport across the epithelium is at least one 
      function of the mucosal plexus. Stimulation of the neurones within the mucosal 
      plexus leads to the inhibition of electrolyte absorption.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400

TI  - Structure-function relationships in the neurotoxin Vipoxin from the venom of Vipera 
      ammodytes meridionalis.
PG  - 617-27
AB  - The neurotoxic complex Vipoxin is the lethal component of the venom of Vipera 
      ammodytes meridionalis, the most toxic snake in Europe. It is a complex between a 
      toxic phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and a non-toxic and catalytically inactive protein, 
      stabilizing the enzyme and reducing the activity and toxicity. Structure-function 
      relationships in this complex were studied by spectroscopic methods. A good 
      correlation between the ionization behaviour and accessible surface area (ASA) of 
      the tyrosyl residues was observed. In the toxic PLA2 subunit phenolic groups 
      participate in H-bonding network that stabilizes the catalytically and 
      pharmacologically active conformation. The tryptophan fluorescence decay of Vipoxin 
      is well fitted by two exponentials with lifetimes of 0.1 (54%) and 2.5 (46%) ns. 
      W20P, W31P and W31I are located in the interface between the two subunits and 
      participate in hydrophobic interactions stabilizing the complex. Dissociation of the 
      complex leads to a transition of the tryptophans from hydrophobic to hydrophilic 
      environment, which influences mainly tau2. The longer lifetime is more sensitive to 
      the polarity of the environment. Circular dichroism measurements demonstrate that 
      the two components of the neurotoxin preserve their secondary structure after 
      dissociation of the complex. The results of the spectroscopic studies are in 
      accordance with a mechanism of blockade of transmission across the neuromuscular 
      junctions of the breathing muscles by interaction of a dissociated toxic PLA2 with a 
      membrane. The loss of toxicity is connected with slight changes in the secondary 
      structure of PLA2. CD studies also show a substantial contribution of disulfide 
      bonds to the stability of the neurotoxic complex and its components.

TI  - The experience of starting a poison control centre in Africa--the Ghana experience.
PG  - 267-72
AB  - The need for a poison centre in Ghana has been well demonstrated over the years as 
      evidenced by the occurrence of a variety of cases of poisoning. Important causes are 
      accidental poisoning from mishandling of pesticides, accidental poisoning among 
      children from kerosene and pesticide' ingestion due to unsafe storage methods in the 
      home, use of herbal potions of unknown composition, overdoses of certain 
      pharmaceuticals for illegal abortion, and accidental food poisonings. Bites from 
      venomous animals particularly snakes are also common. Though preparations toward the 
      establishment of a poison control centre started in mid 1999, it was not until early 
      2002 that the operations of a modest information centre commenced. Major roles the 
      centre are currently performing include providing: an information service for health 
      professionals on management advice in cases of poisoning; training for primary 
      health personnel in the management of common poisonings; training for agricultural 
      personnel in prevention and first aid management of pesticide poisoning; public 
      awareness education and information programmes for prevention of poisoning. Some of 
      the important challenges being faced include ensuring adequate sensitization on the 
      need for centers particularly among health professionals, difficulties in acquiring 
      adequate numbers of and appropriate training for staff of the centre, dedicated 
      phone lines, literature and timely acquisition of toxicological data-bases. Others 
      are poor networking among centers in the region and the absence of clinical and 
      laboratory toxicology services dedicated to managing poisonings. The key lessons 
      learned include the need for multi-sectoral involvement and support from the onset, 
      the need to learn from experiences of established centers and the need to model 
      requirements to suit local conditions without compromising the effectiveness of 
      services.

TI  - EDHF, but not NO or prostaglandins, is critical to evoke a conducted dilation upon 
      ACh in hamster arterioles.
PG  - H996-H1004
AB  - Vasomotor reactions upon focal stimulation of arterioles have been shown to be 
      conducted along the vascular wall. Such a conduction, which is assumed to reflect 
      the spread of electrical signals, may contribute to coordination of responses within 
      a vascular segment. We aimed to identify which endothelial autacoid(s) act as 
      mediators of the local and conducted dilator responses, respectively. To this end, 
      arterioles in the hamster cremaster microcirculation were locally stimulated with 
      endothelium-dependent [acetylcholine (ACh)] or endothelium-independent dilators 
      [sodium nitroprusside (SNP)], and the resulting changes in diameter were measured 
      using a videomicroscopy technique at the site of application and up to 1.4 mm 
      upstream at distant sites. Experiments were also performed after blockade of nitric 
      oxide (NO) synthase, cyclooxygenase, P-450 monooxygenase, or K(+) channels. 
      Dilations upon ACh (71 +/- 3%) were conducted rapidly (<1 s) to upstream sites (at 
      1.4 mm: 37 +/- 5%). Although the NO donor SNP induced a similar local dilation (71 
      +/- 7%), this response was not conducted. Maximal amplitudes of ACh-induced 
      dilations were not attenuated after inhibition of NO synthase and cyclooxygenase at 
      the local and remote sites. However, additional treatment with a P-450 monooxygenase 
      blocker (sulfaphenazole) strongly attenuated the local response (from 62 +/- 9 to 17 
      +/- 5%) and abrogated dilations at distant sites (at 0.67 mm: from 23 +/- 4% to 4 
      +/- 3%). Likewise, 17-octadecynoic acid strongly attenuated local and remote 
      responses. Blockers of Ca(2+)-dependent K(+) channels (charybdotoxin or iberiotoxin) 
      attenuated dilations at the local and remote sites after focal application at the 
      ACh stimulation site. In marked contrast, treatment of the upstream site with these 
      blockers was without any effect. We conclude that upon local stimulation with ACh, a 
      cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase product is generated that induces local dilation via 
      the activation of Ca(2+)-dependent K(+) channels and initiates conduction of the 
      dilation. In contrast to the local site, neither activation of these K(+) channels 
      nor the synthesis of NO or prostaglandins is necessary to dilate the arterioles at 
      remote, distant sites. This suggests that endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor 
      serves as an important mediator to initiate conducted dilations and, by doing so, 
      may act as a key player in the coordination of arteriolar behavior in the 
      microcirculatory network.

TI  - Specific binding of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to phospholipase 
      A2: structure of the complex formed between phospholipase A2 and diclofenac at 2.7 A 
      resolution.
PG  - 410-6
AB  - Type IIA secretory phospholipase A2 (PLA2) enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of the 
      sn-2 ester bond of glycerophospholipids to release fatty acids and 
      lysophospholipids. In order to elucidate the role of PLA2 in inflammatory disorders 
      and to determine the mode of binding of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
      (NSAIDs) to PLA2, the detailed three-dimensional structure of a complex formed 
      between a group IIA PLA2 from Daboia russelli pulchella and 
      2-[(2,6-dichlorophenyl)amino]benzeneacetic acid (diclofenac) has been determined. 
      The preformed complex was crystallized by equilibrating the protein solution against 
      a mixture of 0.20 M ammonium sulfate and 30% PEG 4000. The crystals belong to space 
      group P4(3), with unit-cell parameters a = b = 53.0, c = 48.4 A. The structure was 
      solved by the molecular-replacement method and refined to R(cryst) and R(free) 
      factors of 0.192 and 0.211, respectively, using reflections to 2.7 A resolution. The 
      structure showed that diclofenac occupies a very favourable position in the centre 
      of the substrate-binding hydrophobic channel that allows a number of intermolecular 
      interactions. The binding mode of diclofenac involved crucial interactions with 
      important residues for substrate recognition such as Asp49, His48 and Gly30. In 
      addition, it included three new interactions involving its Cl atoms with Phe5, Ala18 
      and Tyr22. It also showed an extensive network of hydrophobic interactions involving 
      almost all of the residues of the substrate-binding hydrophobic channel. The binding 
      affinity of diclofenac was determined using surface plasmon resonance, which gave an 
      equilibrium constant of 4.8 +/- 0.2 x 10(-8) M.

TI  - First report on azaspiracid and yessotoxin groups detection in French shellfish.
PG  - 39-48

AB  - The French Phytoplankton and Phycotoxins monitoring network (REPHY) recently found 
      positive or dubious negative shellfish samples using lipophilic toxins mouse 
      bioassay. These samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography (LC) in combination 
      with mass spectrometry (MS) to detect the following toxins: okadaic acid (OA), 
      dinophysistoxins (DTXs), pectenotoxins (PTXs), azaspiracids (AZAs), yessotoxins 
      (YTXs), spirolides (SPXs) and gymnodimines (GYMs). Over the 2006-2007 period, 
      chemical analyses revealed various lipophilic toxin profiles according to shellfish 
      sampling locations. In addition to OA and/or PTX-2 and their derivatives, several 
      other compounds were found for the first time in France: (1) during the summer of 
      2006, AZA-1 and AZA-2 in Queen scallops (Aequipecten opercularis) from Northern 
      Brittany; (2) during the summer of 2007, YTX and its major metabolites 
      (45-hydroxy-YTX, homo-YTX, carboxy-YTX) in shellfish from the Mediterranean coast. 
      Regarding YTX-group, the toxin profiles evolution in mussels during summer showed 
      that: (i) the carboxy-YTX depuration rate was much slower than the YTX and 
      45-hydroxy-YTX ones; (ii) the homo-YTX concentration, which was initially very weak, 
      increased significantly during the last depuration phase, which seems to reveal a 
      YTX-group high metabolisation level in mussels. This paper reports for the first 
      time on AZA and YTX-groups detection in French shellfish.

TI  - A combined blockade of glycine and calcium-dependent potassium channels abolishes 
      the respiratory rhythm.
PG  - 831-41
AB  - In order to test whether glycinergic inhibition is essential for the in vivo 
      respiratory rhythm, we analysed the discharge properties of neurones in the 
      medullary respiratory network after blockade of glycine receptors in the in situ 
      perfused brainstem preparation of mature wild type and oscillator mice with a 
      deficient glycine receptor. In wild type mice, selective blockade of glycine 
      receptors with low concentrations of strychnine (0.03-0.3 microM) provoked 
      considerable changes in neuronal discharge characteristics: The cycle phase 
      relationship of inspiratory, post-inspiratory and expiratory specific patterns of 
      membrane potential changes was altered profoundly. Inspiratory, post-inspiratory and 
      expiratory neurones developed a propensity for fast voltage oscillations that were 
      accompanied by multiple burst discharges. These burst discharges were followed by 
      "after-burst" hyperpolarisations that were capable of triggering secondary burst 
      discharges. Blockade of glycine receptors and the "big" Ca2+-dependent 
      K+-conductance by charybdotoxin (3.3 nM) resulted in loss of the respiratory rhythm, 
      whilst only tonic discharge activity remained. In contrast, rhythmic activity was 
      only weakened, but preserved after the "small" Ca2+-dependent activated K+ 
      conductance was blocked with apamin (8 nM). Also low concentrations of pentobarbital 
      sodium (6 mg/kg) abolished rhythmic respiratory activity after blockade of glycine 
      receptors in the wild type mice and in glycine receptor deficient oscillator mice. 
      The data imply that failure of glycine receptors provokes enhanced bursting 
      behaviour of respiratory neurones, whilst the additional blockade of BKCa channels 
      by charybdotoxin or with pentobarbital abolishes the respiratory rhythm.

TI  - A portable microelectrode array recording system incorporating cultured neuronal 
      networks for neurotoxin detection.
PG  - 1339-47
AB  - Cultured neuronal networks, which have the capacity to respond to a wide range of 
      neuroactive compounds, have been suggested to be useful for both screening known 
      analytes and unknown compounds for acute neuropharmacologic effects. Extracellular 
      recording from cultured neuronal networks provides a means for extracting 
      physiologically relevant activity, i.e. action potential firing, in a noninvasive 
      manner conducive for long-term measurements. Previous work from our laboratory 
      described prototype portable systems capable of high signal-to-noise extracellular 
      recordings from cardiac myocytes. The present work describes a portable system 
      tailored to monitoring neuronal extracellular potentials that readily incorporates 
      standardized microelectrode arrays developed by and in use at the University of 
      North Texas. This system utilizes low noise amplifier and filter boards, a two-stage 
      thermal control system with integrated fluidics and a graphical user interface for 
      data acquisition and control implemented on a personal computer. Wherever possible, 
      off-the-shelf components have been utilized for system design and fabrication. 
      During use with cultured neuronal networks, the system typically exhibits input 
      referred noise levels of only 4-6 microVRMS, such that extracellular potentials 
      exceeding 40 microV can be readily resolved. A flow rate of up to 1 ml/min was 
      achieved while the cell recording chamber temperature was maintained within a range 
      of 36-37 degrees C. To demonstrate the capability of this system to resolve small 
      extracellular potentials, pharmacological experiments with cultured neuronal 
      networks have been performed using ion channel blockers, tetrodotoxin and 
      tityustoxin. The implications of the experiments for neurotoxin detection are 
      discussed.

TI  - Short- and long-term differential effects of neuroprotective drug NS-7 on 
      voltage-dependent sodium channels in adrenal chromaffin cells.
PG  - 779-87
AB  - In cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin cells, NS-7 
      [4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-methyl-6-(5-piperidinopentyloxy) pyrimidine hydrochloride], a 
      newly-synthesized neuroprotective drug, inhibited veratridine-induced (22)Na(+) 
      influx via voltage-dependent Na(+) channels (IC(50)=11.4 microM). The inhibition by 
      NS-7 occurred in the presence of ouabain, an inhibitor of Na(+),K(+) ATPase, but 
      disappeared at higher concentration of veratridine, and upon the washout of NS-7. 
      NS-7 attenuated veratridine-induced (45)Ca(2+) influx via voltage-dependent Ca(2+) 
      channels (IC(50)=20.0 microM) and catecholamine secretion (IC(50)=25.8 microM). 
      Chronic (>/=12 h) treatment of cells with NS-7 increased cell surface [(3)H]-STX 
      binding by 86% (EC(50)=10.5 microM; t(1/2)=27 h), but did not alter the K(D) value; 
      it was prevented by cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, or brefeldin 
      A, an inhibitor of vesicular transport from the trans-Golgi network, but was not 
      associated with increased levels of Na(+) channel alpha- and beta(1)-subunit mRNAs. 
      In cells subjected to chronic NS-7 treatment, (22)Na(+) influx caused by veratridine 
      (site 2 toxin), alpha-scorpion venom (site 3 toxin) or beta-scorpion venom (site 4 
      toxin) was suppressed even after the extensive washout of NS-7, and 
      veratridine-induced (22)Na(+) influx remained depressed even at higher concentration 
      of veratridine; however, either alpha- or beta-scorpion venom, or Ptychodiscus 
      brevis toxin-3 (site 5 toxin) enhanced veratridine-induced (22)Na(+) influx as in 
      nontreated cells. These results suggest that in the acute treatment, NS-7 binds to 
      the site 2 and reversibly inhibits Na(+) channels, thereby reducing Ca(2+) channel 
      gating and catecholamine secretion. Chronic treatment with NS-7 up-regulates cell 
      surface Na(+) channels via translational and externalization events, but 
      persistently inhibits Na(+) channel gating without impairing the cooperative 
      interaction between the functional domains of Na(+) channels.

TI  - Effect of O-superfamily conotoxin SO3 on synchronized spontaneous calcium spikes in 
      cultured hippocampal networks.
PG  - 11-7
AB  - SO3 belongs to the O-superfamily of conotoxins and is known to have analgesic 
      effects in experimental animals. In order to explore the mechanism of its potential 
      pharmacological actions, the effect of SO3 on synchronized spontaneous calcium 
      spikes was examined in cultured hippocampal networks by calcium imaging. Spontaneous 
      oscillations of intracellular concentrations of calcium (Ca(2+)) in the form of 
      waves and spikes are found in cultured hippocampal networks. Exposure to increasing 
      concentrations of SO3 resulted in a progressive decrease in synchronized spontaneous 
      calcium spikes. The higher concentrations (0.1 micromol/L and 1 micromol/L) of SO3 
      showed the strongest inhibition. The rank order of inhibition was 1 micromol/L > 0.1 
      micromol/L > 10 micromol/L > 0.01 micromol/L. This action of SO3 in reducing 
      synchronized calcium spikes suggests a possible application for therapeutic 
      treatment of epilepsy.

TI  - Pacing of interstitial cells of Cajal in the murine gastric antrum: neurally 
      mediated and direct stimulation.
PG  - 545-59
AB  - Phase advancement of electrical slow waves and regulation of pacemaker frequency was 
      investigated in the circular muscle layer of the gastric antra of wild-type and 
      W/W(V) mice. Slow waves in the murine antrum of wild-type animals had an intrinsic 
      frequency of 4.4 cycles min(-1) and were phase advanced and entrained to a maximum 
      of 6.3 cycles min(-1) using 0.1 ms pulses of electrical field stimulation (EFS) 
      (three pulses delivered at 3-30 Hz). Pacing of slow waves was blocked by 
      tetrodotoxin (TTX) and atropine, suggesting phase advancement was mediated via 
      intrinsic cholinergic nerves. Phase advancement and entrainment of slow waves via 
      this mechanism was absent in W/W(V) mutants which lack intramuscular interstitial 
      cells of Cajal (ICC-IM). These data suggest that neural regulation of slow wave 
      frequency and regulation of smooth muscle responses to slow waves are mediated via 
      nerve-ICC-IM interactions. With longer stimulation parameters (1.0-2.0 ms), EFS 
      phase advanced and entrained slow waves in wild-type and W/W(V) animals. Pacing with 
      1-2 ms pulses was not inhibited by TTX or atropine. These data suggest that 
      stimulation with longer pulse duration is capable of directly activating the 
      pacemaker mechanism in ICC-MY networks. In summary, intrinsic excitatory neurons can 
      phase advance and increase the frequency of antral slow waves. This form of 
      regulation is mediated via ICC-IM. Longer pulse stimulation can directly activate 
      ICC-MY in the absence of ICC-IM.

TI  - Structurally homologous toxins isolated from the Taiwan cobra (Naja naja atra) 
      differ significantly in their structural stability.
PG  - 107-15
AB  - Cardiotoxin and neurotoxin analogues isolated from snake venom sources are highly 
      homologous proteins (>50% homology) with similar three-dimensional structures but 
      exhibit drastically different biological properties. In the present study, we 
      compare the conformational stability of cardiotoxin analogue III (CTX III) and 
      cobrotoxin (CBTX), a neurotoxin analogue, from the Taiwan cobra (Naja naja atra), 
      using circular dichroism spectroscopy and hydrogen-deuterium (H/D) exchange 
      techniques in conjunction with two-dimensional NMR methods. Contrary to 
      expectations, it is found that CTX III and CBTX differ significantly in their 
      structural stabilities. The three-dimensional structure of CBTX is less stable than 
      that of CTX III. The amide protons of residues at the N- and C-terminal ends of the 
      CTX III molecule are strongly protected against H/D exchange, implying that the 
      terminal ends of the molecule are bridged together by significant numbers of 
      hydrogen bonds. However, in CBTX, amide protons at the terminal ends of the molecule 
      do not exhibit an significant protection against H/D exchange. Comparison of the 
      protection factors of the various amide protons in CTX III and CBTX reveals that the 
      extraordinary stability of CTX III stems from the strong network of interactions 
      among the residues at the N- and C-terminal ends and also due to the tight and 
      ordered packing of the nonpolar residues involved in the triple-stranded, 
      anti-parallel, beta-sheet segment of the molecule.

TI  - Synapse-specific contribution of the variation of transmitter concentration to the 
      decay of inhibitory postsynaptic currents.
PG  - 1251-61
AB  - Synaptic transmission is characterized by a remarkable trial-to-trial variability in 
      the postsynaptic response, influencing the way in which information is processed in 
      neuronal networks. This variability may originate from the probabilistic nature of 
      quantal transmitter release, from the stochastic behavior of the receptors, or from 
      the fluctuation of the transmitter concentration in the cleft. We combined 
      nonstationary noise analysis and modeling techniques to estimate the contribution of 
      transmitter fluctuation to miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current (mIPSC) 
      variability. A substantial variability (approximately 30%) in mIPSC decay was found 
      in all cell types studied (neocortical layer2/3 pyramidal cells, granule cells of 
      the olfactory bulb, and interneurons of the cerebellar molecular layer). This large 
      variability was not solely the consequence of the expression of multiple types of 
      GABA(A) receptors, as a similar mIPSC decay variability was observed in cerebellar 
      interneurons that express only a single type (alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2)) of GABA(A) 
      receptor. At large synapses on these cells, all variance in mIPSC decay could be 
      accounted for by the stochastic behavior of approximately 36 pS channels, consistent 
      with the conductance of alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2) GABA(A) receptors at physiological 
      temperatures. In contrast, at small synapses, a significant amount of variability in 
      the synaptic cleft GABA transient had to be present to account for the additional 
      variance in IPSC decay over that produced by stochastic channel openings. Thus, our 
      results suggest a synapse-specific contribution of the variation of the 
      spatiotemporal profile of GABA to the decay of IPSCs.

TI  - Tackling lipophilicity of peptide drugs: replacement of the backbone N-methyl group 
      of cilengitide by N-oligoethylene glycol (N-OEG) chains.
PG  - 11-7
LID - 10.1021/bc4003844 [doi]
AB  - Cilengitide is an RGD-peptide of sequence cyclo[RGDfNMeV] that was was developed as 
      a highly active and selective ligand for the αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrin receptors. We 
      describe the synthesis of three analogues of this peptide in which the N-Me group 
      has been replaced by N-oligoethylene glycol (N-OEG) chains of increasing size: 
      namely N-OEG2, N-OEG11, and N-OEG23, which are respectively composed of 2, 11, and 
      23 ethylene oxide monomer units. The different N-OEG cyclopeptides and the original 
      peptide were compared with respect to lipophilicity and biological activity. The 
      N-OEG2 analogue was straightforward to synthesize in solid phase using an 
      Fmoc-N-OEG2 building block. The syntheses of the N-OEG11 and N-OEG23 cyclopeptides 
      are hampered by the increased steric hindrance of the N-substituent, and could only 
      be achieved by segment coupling, which takes place with epimerization and thus 
      requires extensive product purification. All the N-OEG analogues were found to be 
      more hydrophobic than the parent peptide, and their hydrophobicity was 
      systematically enhanced upon increasing the length of the OEG chain. The N-OEG2 
      cyclopeptide displayed the same capacity as Cilengitide to inhibit the 
      integrin-mediated adhesion of HUVEC endothelial, DAOY gliobastoma, and HT-29 colon 
      cancer cells to their ligands vitronectin and fibrinogen. The N-OEG11 and N-OEG23 
      analogues also inhibited cell adhesion to these immobilized ligands, but their IC50 
      values dropped by 1 order of magnitude with respect to the parent peptide. These 
      results indicate that replacement of the backbone N-Me group of Cilengitide by a 
      short N-OEG chain provides a more lipophilic analogue with a similar biological 
      activity. Upon increasing the size of the N-OEG chain, liophilicity is enhanced, but 
      synthetic yields drop and the longer polymer chains may impede targeted binding.

TI  - Selective lesioning of the cat pre-Bötzinger complex in vivo eliminates breathing 
      but not gasping.
PG  - 895-907
AB  - 1. To examine the functional importance of the pre-Bötzinger complex for breathing 
      we micro-injected, under in vivo conditions, the calcium channel blocker 
      omega-conotoxin GVIA and the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX) into the 
      ventrolateral medulla of adult cats, while monitoring respiratory rhythmic motor 
      output in the phrenic nerve. 2. omega-Conotoxin GVIA caused a highly localized 
      synaptic ablation by blocking presynaptic N-type calcium channels. When injecting 
      5-60 fmol omega-conotoxin GVIA unilaterally, the amplitude of phrenic nerve activity 
      decreased bilaterally and sometimes disappeared, indicating central apnoea. These 
      effects were reversible and could only be induced in a very localized area of the 
      pre-Botzinger complex. By injecting omega-conotoxin GVIA several times during an 
      experiment and analysing the areas where injections affected respiratory activity, 
      it was possible to map exactly the anatomical extent of the area critical for 
      respiratory rhythm generation. 3. Following the precise localization of the 
      pre-Bötzinger complex with omega-conotoxin GVIA, we injected TTX to induce an 
      irreversible inactivation of this region. TTX injected unilaterally into the 
      pre-Bötzinger complex irreversibly reduced the amplitude of phrenic nerve activity. 
      Bilateral TTX injections eliminated respiratory rhythmic activity, causing a 
      persistent central apnoea. 4. After bilateral lesioning of the pre-Bötzinger 
      complex, it was still possible to induce gasping during hypoxia or asphyxia, 
      indicating that respiration and gasping are generated by two different neuronal 
      networks. 5. We propose that omega-conotoxin GVIA as employed in this study to 
      investigate the functional role of the pre-Bötzinger complex can also be used as a 
      general pharmacological approach to map other neuronal networks. We call this the 
      'omega-conotoxin GVIA tracing' method.

TI  - Heterogeneous increases of cytoplasmic calcium: distinct effects on down-regulation 
      of cell surface sodium channels and sodium channel subunit mRNA levels.
PG  - 1455-66
AB  - 1. Long-term (> or = 12 h) treatment of cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin cells 
      with A23187 (a Ca(2+) ionophore) or thapsigargin (TG) [an inhibitor of 
      sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA)] caused a time- and 
      concentration-dependent reduction of cell surface [(3)H]-saxitoxin (STX) binding 
      capacity, but did not change the K:(D:) value. In A23187- or TG-treated cells, 
      veratridine-induced (22)Na(+) influx was reduced (with no change in veratridine 
      EC(50) value) while it was enhanced by alpha-scorpion venom, beta-scorpion venom, or 
      Ptychodiscus brevis toxin-3, like in nontreated cells. 2. The A23187- or TG-induced 
      decrease of [(3)H]-STX binding was diminished by BAPTA-AM. EGTA also inhibited the 
      decreasing effect of A23187. A23187 caused a rapid, monophasic and persistent 
      increase in intracellular concentration of Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) to a greater extent 
      than that observed with TG. 2,5-Di-(t-butyl)-1,4-benzohydroquinone (DBHQ) (an 
      inhibitor of SERCA) produced only a rapid monophasic increase in [Ca(2+)](i), 
      without any effect on [(3)H]-STX binding. 3. Reduction in [(3)H]-STX binding 
      capacity induced by A23187 or TG was attenuated by Gö6976 (an inhibitor of 
      conventional protein kinase C) or calpastatin peptide (an inhibitor of calpain). 
      When the internalization rate of cell surface Na(+) channels was measured in the 
      presence of brefeldin A (an inhibitor of vesicular exit from the trans-Golgi 
      network), A23187 or TG accelerated the reduction of [(3)H]-STX binding capacity. 4. 
      Six hours treatment with A23187 lowered Na(+) channel alpha- and beta(1)-subunit 
      mRNA levels, whereas TG had no effect. 5. These results suggest that elevation of 
      [Ca(2+)](i) caused by A23187, TG or DBHQ exerted differential effects on 
      down-regulation of cell surface functional Na(+) channels and Na(+) channel subunit 
      mRNA levels.

TI  - Neurotrophins inhibit major histocompatibility class II inducibility of microglia: 
      involvement of the p75 neurotrophin receptor.
PG  - 5779-84
AB  - Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules are rare in the healthy brain 
      tissue, but are heavily expressed on microglial cells after inflammatory or 
      neurodegenerative processes. We studied the conditions leading to the induction of 
      MHC class II molecules in microglia by using explant cultures of neonatal rat 
      hippocampus, a model of interacting neuronal networks. Interferon-gamma 
      (IFN-gamma)-dependent MHC class II inducibility in microglia cells was very low, but 
      strongly increased in the hippocampal slices after the blockade of neuronal activity 
      by neurotoxins [tetrodotoxin (TTX), omega-conotoxin] or glutamate antagonists. None 
      of these agents acted directly on isolated microglia cells. We found that 
      neurotrophins modulate microglial MHC class II expression. MHC class II inducibility 
      was enhanced by neutralization of neurotrophins produced locally within the cultured 
      tissues and was inhibited by the addition of nerve growth factor (NGF), 
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), or neurotrophin-3 (NT3). NGF and, to a 
      lower extent, NT3 acted directly on isolated microglia via the p75 neurotrophin 
      receptor and inhibited MHC class II inducibility as shown by blockade of the p75 
      neurotrophin receptor with antibodies. Our data suggest that neurotrophins secreted 
      by electrically active neurons control the antigen-presenting potential of microglia 
      cells, and indicate that this effect is mediated partly via the p75 neurotrophin 
      receptor.

TI  - Agonist-induced rise in intracellular calcium of lens epithelial cells: effects on 
      the actin cytoskeleton.
PG  - 191-201
AB  - Primary cultures of rabbit and skate lens epithelia were used to investigate the 
      effect of calcium release from intracellular stores upon the actin cytoskeleton. 
      Primary cultures were loaded with fura-2 AM and intracellular calcium, i.e. (Ca2+)i, 
      quantitated using a Hamamatsu Photonics digital imaging system. Agonists used were 
      bombesin, inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), thapsigargin (Tg), neuropeptide Y 
      (NPY) and calcium chloride. Recordings were typically made on seven cells in each 
      case. We found that IP3 caused a 6-8-fold immediate release of (Ca2+)i in rabbit 
      cells, but skate cells showed no response unless permeabilized with saponin, 
      whereupon an increase of about 50% occurred. Tg induced release from internal stores 
      in rabbit cells, but had no effect on skate cells. Bombesin caused a large increase 
      in (Ca2+)i release in both, while NPY had no effect in either. Skate cells incubated 
      in calcium-free EGTA-Ringer's solution responded rapidly to addition of 5 mM CaCl2, 
      whereas only three of 35 rabbit cells responded, and in gradual fashion. After 
      calcium imaging, the cells were fixed and stained with rhodamine phalloidin or with 
      an antibody against IP3 receptor (IP3R) conjugated to FITC. Fluorescence microscopy 
      revealed that the actin cytoskeleton had reorganized from the normal stress fiber 
      pattern into polygonal networks. Tg caused the same structures to form in rabbit 
      cells, but bombesin had no effect. IP3 receptor was located intracellularly, 
      presumably on endoplasmic reticulum, and was not associated with plasma membranes. 
      The rapid response of rabbit cells may have been caused by the DMSO in which fura-2 
      was dissolved. We have found an interesting difference in agonist-induced calcium 
      release between rabbit and skate cells. The latter may utilize either a Ca-Na 
      exchanger or capacitative calcium entry, which could reflect a difference in lens 
      accommodative mechanisms. This seems relevant in view of the fact that the rabbit 
      lens accommodates through change in shape, whereas the skate lens does so through 
      translation of position.

TI  - Bioaccumulation of algal toxins and changes in physiological parameters in 
      Mediterranean mussels from the North Adriatic Sea (Italy).
PG  - 451-70
LID - 10.1002/tox.20739 [doi]
AB  - The Northwestern Adriatic Sea is a commercially important area in aquaculture, 
      accounting for about 90% of the Italian mussel production, and it was subjected to 
      recurring cases of mussel farm closures due to toxic algae poisoning. A spatial and 
      temporal survey of four sites along the North Adriatic Sea coasts of Emilia Romagna 
      (Italy) was undertaken to study the possible impairments of physiological parameters 
      in Mytilus galloprovincialis naturally exposed to algal toxins. The sites were 
      selected as part of the monitoring network for the assessment of algal toxins 
      bioaccumulation by the competent Authority. Samples positive to paralytic shellfish 
      toxins and to lipophilic toxins were detected through the mouse bioassay. Lipophilic 
      toxins were assessed by HPLC. Decreasing yessotoxins (YTX) levels were observed in 
      mussels from June to December, while homo-YTX contents increased concomitantly. 
      Lysosome membrane stability (LMS), glutathione S-transferase and catalase 
      activities, and multixenobiotic resistance (MXR)-related gene expressions were 
      assessed as parameters related to the mussel health status and widely utilized in 
      environmental biomonitoring. Levels of cAMP were also measured, as possibly involved 
      in the algal toxin mechanisms of action. Low LMS values were observed in hemocytes 
      from mussels positive to the mouse bioassay. MXR-related gene expressions were 
      greatly inhibited in mussels positive to the mouse bioassay. Clear correlations were 
      established between increasing homo-YTX contents (and decreasing YTX) and increasing 
      cAMP levels in the tissues. Similarly, significant correlations were established 
      between the increase of homo-YTX and cAMP levels, and the expressions of three 
      MXR-related genes at submaximal toxin concentrations. In conclusion, YTXs may affect 
      mussel physiological parameters, including hemocyte functionality, gene expression 
      and cell signaling.

TI  - Studies on the ultrastructure of fibrin lacking fibrinopeptide B (beta-fibrin).
PG  - 1073-81
AB  - Release of fibrinopeptide B from fibrinogen by copperhead venom procoagulant enzyme 
      results in a form of fibrin (beta-fibrin) with weaker self-aggregation 
      characteristics than the normal product (alpha beta-fibrin) produced by release of 
      fibrinopeptides A (FPA) and B (FPB) by thrombin. We investigated the ultrastructure 
      of these two types of fibrin as well as that of beta-fibrin prepared from fibrinogen 
      Metz (A alpha 16 Arg----Cys), a homozygous dysfibrinogenemic mutant that does not 
      release FPA. At 14 degrees C and physiologic solvent conditions (0.15 mol/L of NaCl, 
      0.015 mol/L of Tris buffer pH 7.4), the turbidity (350 nm) of rapidly polymerizing 
      alpha beta-fibrin (thrombin 1 to 2 U/mL) plateaued in less than 6 min and formed a 
      "coarse" matrix consisting of anastomosing fiber bundles (mean diameter 92 nm). More 
      slowly polymerizing alpha beta-fibrin (thrombin 0.01 and 0.001 U/mL) surpassed this 
      turbidity after greater than or equal to 60 minutes and concomitantly developed a 
      network of thicker fiber bundles (mean diameters 118 and 186 nm, respectively). Such 
      matrices also contained networks of highly branched, twisting, "fine" fibrils (fiber 
      diameters 7 to 30 nm) that are usually characteristic of matrices formed at high 
      ionic strength and pH. Slowly polymerizing beta-fibrin, like slowly polymerizing 
      alpha beta-fibrin, displayed considerable quantities of fine matrix in addition to 
      an underlying thick cable network (mean fiber diameter 135 nm), whereas rapidly 
      polymerizing beta-fibrin monomer was comprised almost exclusively of wide, poorly 
      anastomosed, striated cables (mean diameter 212 nm). Metz beta-fibrin clots were 
      more fragile than those of normal beta-fibrin and were comprised almost entirely of 
      a fine network. Metz fibrin could be induced, however, to form thick fiber bundles 
      (mean diameter 76 nm) in the presence of albumin at a concentration (500 mumol/L) in 
      the physiologic range and resembled a Metz plasma fibrin clot in that regard. The 
      diminished capacity of Metz beta-fibrin to form thick fiber bundles may be due to 
      impaired use or occupancy of a polymerization site exposed by FPB release. Our 
      results indicate that twisting fibrils are an inherent structural feature of all 
      forms of assembling fibrin, and suggest that mature beta-fibrin or alpha beta-fibrin 
      clots develop from networks of thin fibrils that have the ability to coalesce to 
      form thicker fiber bundles.

TI  - Effects of nicotine in the dopaminergic system of mice lacking the alpha4 subunit of 
      neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.
PG  - 1329-37
AB  - The mesostriatal dopaminergic system influences locomotor activity and the 
      reinforcing properties of many drugs of abuse including nicotine. Here we 
      investigate the role of the alpha4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit 
      in mediating the effects of nicotine in the mesolimbic dopamine system in mice 
      lacking the alpha4 subunit. We show that there are two distinct populations of 
      receptors in the substantia nigra and striatum by using autoradiographic labelling 
      with 125I alpha-conotoxin MII. These receptors are comprised of the alpha4, beta2 
      and alpha6 nAChR subunits and non-alpha4, beta2, and alpha6 nAChR subunits. 
      Non-alpha4 subunit-containing nAChRs are located on dopaminergic neurons, are 
      functional and respond to nicotine as demonstrated by patch clamp recordings. In 
      vivo microdialysis performed in awake, freely moving mice reveal that mutant mice 
      have basal striatal dopamine levels which are twice as high as those observed in 
      wild-type mice. Despite the fact that both wild-type and alpha4 null mutant mice 
      show a similar increase in dopamine release in response to intrastriatal KCl 
      perfusion, a nicotine-elicited increase in dopamine levels is not observed in mutant 
      mice. Locomotor activity experiments show that there is no difference between 
      wild-type and mutant mice in basal activity in both habituated and non-habituated 
      environments. Interestingly, mutant mice sustain an increase in cocaine-elicited 
      locomotor activity longer than wild-type mice. In addition, mutant mice recover from 
      depressant locomotor activity in response to nicotine at a faster rate. Our results 
      indicate that alpha4-containing nAChRs exert a tonic control on striatal basal 
      dopamine release, which is mediated by a heterogeneous population of nAChRs.

TI  - Suppression of the rat microglia Kv1.3 current by src-family tyrosine kinases and 
      oxygen/glucose deprivation.
PG  - 1949-60
AB  - Microglia activate following numerous acute insults to the brain, including 
      oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD), and both protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and K+ 
      channels have been implicated in their activation. We identified Kv1.3 
      (voltage-gated potassium channel) protein in cultured rat microglia and confirmed 
      that the native current is biophysically and pharmacologically similar to Kv1. 3. To 
      explore whether src-family PTKs regulate the microglial Kv current, we first 
      heterologously expressed Kv1.3 in a microglia-like cell line derived from neonatal 
      rat brain (MLS-9). The resulting large Kv1.3 current was eliminated by 
      co-transfecting the constitutively active PTK, v-src, then rapidly restored by the 
      PTK inhibitor, lavendustin A. Acute activation of endogenous src kinases by a 
      peptide activator significantly reduced the current, an effect that was mimicked by 
      OGD. Similarly, in primary cultures of rat microglia, the endogenous Kv1.3-like 
      current was inhibited by activating endogenous src-family PTKs and by OGD. 
      Biochemical analysis showed that OGD increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of 
      native Kv1.3 protein, which was alleviated by PTK inhibitors or reactive oxygen 
      species (ROS) scavengers. Conversely, the basal level of Kv1.3 phosphorylation was 
      decreased by PTK inhibitors or scavengers of ROS. Together, our results point to a 
      post-insertional downregulation of the microglial Kv1.3-like current by oxidative 
      stress and tyrosine phosphorylation. This interaction may be facilitated by a 
      multiprotein complex because, in cultured microglia, the endogenous Kv1.3 and src 
      proteins both bind to the scaffolding protein, post-synaptic density protein 95 
      (PSD-95). By associating with, and phosphorylating Kv1.3, src is well positioned to 
      regulate microglial responses to oxidative stress.

TI  - Endogenous and exogenous dopamine presynaptically inhibits glutamatergic 
      reticulospinal transmission via an action of D2-receptors on N-type Ca2+ channels.
PG  - 447-54
AB  - In this study, the effects of exogenously applied and endogenously released dopamine 
      (DA), a powerful modulator of the lamprey locomotor network, are examined on 
      excitatory glutamatergic synaptic transmission between reticulospinal axons and 
      spinal neurons. Bath application of DA (1-50 micro m) reduced the amplitude of 
      monosynaptic reticulospinal-evoked glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic potentials 
      (EPSPs). The effect of DA was blocked by the D2-receptor antagonist eticlopride, and 
      mimicked by the selective D2-receptor agonist 2,10,11 
      trihydroxy-N-propyl-noraporphine hydrobromide (TNPA). Bath application of the DA 
      reuptake blocker bupropion, which increases the extracellular level of dopamine, 
      also reduced the monosynaptic EPSP amplitude. This effect was also blocked by the 
      D2-receptor antagonist eticlopride. To investigate if the action of DA was exerted 
      at the presynaptic level, the reticulospinal axon action potentials were prolonged 
      by administering K+ channel antagonists while blocking l-type Ca2+ channels. A 
      remaining Ca2+ component, mainly dependent on N and P/Q channels, was depressed by 
      DA. When DA (25-50 micro m) was applied in the presence of omega-conotoxin GVIA, a 
      toxin specific for N-type Ca2+ channels, it failed to affect the monosynaptic EPSP 
      amplitude. DA did not affect the response to extracellularly ejected d-glutamate, 
      the postsynaptic membrane potential, or the electrical component of the EPSPs. DA 
      thus acts at the presynaptic level to modulate reticulospinal transmission.

TI  - Alternative splicing of a beta4 subunit proline-rich motif regulates 
      voltage-dependent gating and toxin block of Cav2.1 Ca2+ channels.
PG  - 9331-9
AB  - Ca2+ channel beta subunits modify alpha1 subunit gating properties through direct 
      interactions with intracellular linker domains. In a previous report (Helton and 
      Horne, 2002), we showed that alternative splicing of the beta4 subunit had alpha1 
      subunit subtype-specific effects on Ca2+ channel activation and fast inactivation. 
      We extend these findings in the present report to include effects on slow 
      inactivation and block by the peptide toxin omega-conotoxin (CTx)-MVIIC. N-terminal 
      deletion and site-directed mutagenesis experiments revealed that the effects of 
      alternative splicing on toxin block and all aspects of gating could be attributed to 
      a proline-rich motif found within N-terminal beta4b amino acids 10-20. 
      Interestingly, this motif is conserved within the third postsynaptic density-95 
      (PSD-95)/Discs large/zona occludens-1 domain of the distantly related 
      membrane-associated guanylate kinase homolog, PSD-95. Sequence identity of 
      approximately 30% made possible the building of beta4a and beta4b three-dimensional 
      structural models using PSD-95 as the target sequence. The models (1) reveal that 
      alternative splicing of the beta4 N terminus results in dramatic differences in 
      surface charge distribution and (2) localize the proline-rich motif of beta4b to an 
      extended arm structure that flanks what would be the equivalent of a highly modified 
      PSD-95 carboxylate binding loop. Northern blot analysis revealed a markedly 
      different pattern of distribution for beta4a versus beta4b in the human CNS. Whereas 
      beta4a is distributed throughout evolutionarily older regions of the CNS, beta4b is 
      concentrated heavily in the forebrain. These results raise interesting questions 
      about the functional role that alternative splicing of the beta4 subunit has played 
      in the evolution of complex neural networks.

LID - 10.14670/HH-13.1049 [doi]
AB  - Specimens of testis, excurrent duct including the accessory genital glands and 
      urethra throughout its extension were investigated in adult bovines, in order to 
      immunohistochemically localize both the peptidergic innervation and the epithelial 
      cell types belonging to the diffuse endocrine system (DES). Immunoreactivities to 
      GRP, met- and leu-enkephalins, CGRP, NPY, substance P, VIP, somatostatin, 
      beta-endorphin and 5-HT antisera were tested by means of a labelled 
      streptavidin-biotin (LSAB) method. Such regulatory substances were found in 
      components of the peripheral nervous system (nerve fibers in the connective and 
      muscular tissues, sub- and intrapithelial nerve terminals, nerve cells bodies and 
      fibers in intramural ganglia), and in epithelial endocrine/paracrine cells. Bovine 
      urogenital apparatus is supplied by many peptide-containing nerves, which contain in 
      many localizations GRP and enkephalins, and to a lesser extent substance P, CGRP, 
      NPY and VIP. A thin network of peptidergic nerves distributes to the musculature of 
      the canalicular organs and accessory glands. The prostatic complex was especially 
      rich in peptidergic innervation, and also contained somatostatin- and 5-HT-secreting 
      endocrine cells. In addition, 5-HT-immunoreactive endocrine cells were found in the 
      bulbourethral gland and urethral epithelium. CGRP-ir nerves were present contacting 
      striated muscle fibers of urethra (motor end plates). The testis was devoid of any 
      immunoreactivity. These data are compared with those obtained in a companion study 
      carried out the same organs in two species of Equidae (Equus caballus and Equus 
      asinus). Different patterns of immunoreactivities can be outlined in these domestic 
      ungulates.

TI  - Evidence that coated vesicles transport acetylcholine receptors to the surface 
      membrane of chick myotubes.
PG  - 498-506
AB  - Coated vesicles are present in the myoplasm of embryonic chick myotubes grown in 
      vitro. They are most numerous beneath regions of the surface membrane that contain a 
      high density of acetylcholine receptors (AChR). Prolonged exposure of myotubes to 
      saline extract of chick brain increases the number of intracellular AChR and the 
      number of coated vesicles. This suggests that coated vesicles contain AChR, and this 
      hypothesis was tested with horseradish peroxidase-alpha-bungarotoxin (HRP-alpha BTX) 
      conjugates. The conjugates enter saponin-permeabilized cells and, as judged by the 
      inhibition of [125I] alpha BTX binding, they label the entire intracellular AChR 
      pool. Approximately 50% of the coated vesicles contained HRP-alpha BTX reaction 
      product. In addition, reaction product was detected in Golgi cisternae and along 
      membranes that bound a subsurface tubulovesicular network. The majority of labeled 
      vesicles are probably involved in exocytosis rather than endocytosis of AChR because 
      very few coated vesicles were labeled when HRP-alpha BTX was added to the medium 
      bathing intact cells. Moreover, inhibition of protein synthesis with puromycin 
      resulted in a large decrease in the number of labeled vesicles. These results 
      suggest that a subpopulation of coated vesicles ferry newly synthesized AChR to the 
      cell surface.

TI  - Effect of bicuculline on thalamic activity: a direct blockade of IAHP in reticularis 
      neurons.
PG  - 2911-8
AB  - The thalamic reticular nucleus (RTN) is the major source of inhibitory contacts in 
      the thalamus and thus plays an important role in regulating the excitability of the 
      thalamocortical network. Inhibition occurs through GABAergic synapses on relay cells 
      as well as through GABAergic synapses between reticularis neurons themselves. Here 
      we report that the role and mechanisms of this inhibition, which frequently have 
      been studied using N-methyl derivatives of the gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) 
      receptor antagonist bicuculline, should be revisited. Using the whole cell 
      patch-clamp technique in thalamic slices from young rats, we observed an enhancement 
      by bicuculline methiodide, methobromide, and methochloride (collectively referred to 
      as bicuculline-M; 5-60 microM) of the low-threshold calcium spike burst in RTN 
      neurons that persisted in the presence of tetrodotoxin (1 microM) and was not 
      reproduced in picrotoxin (100-300 microM). The effect did not involve activation of 
      any GABA receptor subtype. Voltage-clamp recordings showed that bicuculline-M 
      blocked the current underlying the low-threshold spike burst afterhyperpolarization 
      (AHP), an effect that was mimicked by apamin (100 nM). Recordings from nucleated 
      patches extracted from reticularis neurons demonstrated that this effect was not 
      mediated by modulation of the release of an unidentified neurotransmitter but that 
      bicuculline-M directly blocks small conductance (SK) channels. The AHP-blocking 
      effect also was observed in other brain regions, demonstrating that although 
      bicuculline-M is a potent GABAA receptor antagonist, it is of limited value in 
      assessing GABAergic network interactions, which should be studied using picrotoxin 
      or bicuculline-free base. However, bicuculline-M may provide a useful tool for 
      developing nonpeptide antagonists of SK channels.

TI  - Concerted motions of the integrin-binding loop and the C-terminal tail of the 
      non-RGD disintegrin obtustatin.
PG  - 45570-6
AB  - Obtustatin is a potent and selective inhibitor of the alpha1beta1 integrin in vitro 
      and of angiogenesis in vivo. It possesses an integrin recognition loop that harbors, 
      in a lateral position, the inhibitory 21KTS23 motif. We report an analysis of the 
      dynamics of the backbone and side-chain atoms of obtustatin by homonuclear NMR 
      methods. Angular mobility has been calculated for 90 assigned cross-peaks from 22 
      off-resonance rotating frame nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy spectra recorded 
      at three magnetic fields. Our results suggest that the integrin binding loop and the 
      C-terminal tail display concerted motions, which can be interpreted by hinge 
      effects. Among the integrin-binding motif, threonine 22 and serine 23 exhibit the 
      lowest and the highest side-chain flexibility, respectively. It is noteworthy that 
      the side chain of threonine 22 is not solvent-exposed, although based on synthetic 
      peptides it appears to be the most critical residue for the inhibitory activity of 
      obtustatin on the binding of integrin alpha1beta1 to collagen IV. Instead, the side 
      chain of threonine 22 is oriented toward the loop center and hydrogen-bonded to 
      residues Thr25 and Ser26. This network of interactions explains the restrained 
      mobility of threonine 22 and suggests that its functional importance lies in 
      maintaining the active conformation of the alpha1beta1 inhibitory loop.

TI  - Modulation of neurotransmitter release by dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channels 
      involves tyrosine phosphorylation.
PG  - 279-92
AB  - Cultured rat cerebellar granule cells depolarized by high KCl, display a large 
      component of Ca2+ influx through L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels as defined 
      by a sensitivity to 1 microM nifedipine. This Ca2+ influx is not coupled to 
      neurotransmitter exocytosis but has implications for neuronal development. KCl 
      stimulation in the absence of external Ca2+ followed by the readdition of Ca2+ 
      allows the coupling of a class of L-type Ca2+ channels to neurotransmitter 
      exocytosis as assessed by loading of glutamatergic pools with [3H]-D-aspartate. KCl 
      stimulation in the absence of external Ca2+ ('predepolarization') enhances tyrosine 
      phosphorylation of several cellular proteins, and inhibitors of tyrosine kinases 
      block both phosphorylation and the neurotransmitter release coupled to the L-type 
      Ca2+ channel. More specifically, an inhibitor of src family tyrosine kinases, PP1, 
      blocks the effects of predepolarization suggesting a role for a src family kinase in 
      the process. Furthermore, L-type Ca2+ channel recruitment and modulation of release 
      could be activated with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate. The 
      phosphoproteins enhanced by predepolarization, which include the cytoskeletal 
      proteins focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and vinculin, are also highly phosphorylated 
      early on in culture when neurite outgrowth occurs. As the neurons develop a network 
      of neurites, both tyrosine phosphorylation and L-type Ca2+ channel activity 
      decrease. These results show a novel mechanism for the recruitment of L-type Ca2+ 
      channels and their coupling to neurotransmitter release which involves tyrosine 
      phosphorylation. This phenomenon has a role in cerebellar granule cell development.

TI  - Identification of a potential effector pathway for the trimeric Go protein 
      associated with secretory granules. Go stimulates a granule-bound 
      phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase by activating RhoA in chromaffin cells.
PG  - 16913-20
AB  - Besides having a role in signal transduction, heterotrimeric G proteins may be 
      involved in membrane trafficking events. In chromaffin cells, Go is associated with 
      secretory organelles, and its activation inhibits the ATP-dependent priming of 
      exocytosis. By using permeabilized cells, we previously described that the control 
      exerted by the granule-bound Go on exocytosis may be related to effects on the 
      cortical actin network through a sequence possibly involving Rho. To provide further 
      insight into the function of Rho in exocytosis, we focus here on its intracellular 
      localization in chromaffin cells. By immunoreplica analysis, immunoprecipitation, 
      and confocal immunofluorescence, we found that RhoA is specifically associated with 
      the membrane of secretory chromaffin granules. Parallel subcellular fractionation 
      experiments revealed the occurrence of a mastoparan-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 
      4-kinase activity in purified chromaffin granule membranes. This stimulatory effect 
      of mastoparan was mimicked by GAP-43, an activator of the granule-associated Go, and 
      specifically inhibited by antibodies against Galphao. In addition, Clostridium 
      botulinum C3 exoenzyme completely blocked the activation of phosphatidylinositol 
      4-kinase by mastoparan. We propose that the control exerted by Go on peripheral 
      actin and exocytosis is related to the activation of a downstream RhoA-dependent 
      phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase associated with the membrane of secretory granules.

TI  - A helical capping motif in ShK toxin and its role in helix stabilization.
PG  - 422-36
AB  - ShK toxin, a 35-residue polypeptide cross-linked by three disulfides, is a potent 
      blocker of voltage-gated potassium channels and is of interest as a lead in the 
      development of new immunosuppressant agents. ShK toxin contains two short stretches 
      of alpha-helix, the first of which is preceded by a putative N-capping box 
      encompassing residues Thr13 and Gln16. (1)H and (13)C NMR data support the presence 
      of this structural motif, but the hydrogen bonds involving residues 13 and 16 in the 
      solution structure of ShK toxin do not match the pattern expected for a conventional 
      N-cap motif. They do, however, fit the pattern for the recently described ST-motif, 
      class 4a (Wan and Milner-White (1999) Journal of Molecular Biology, 1999, Vol. 286, 
      pp. 1651-1662). The (1)H NMR chemical shifts, nuclear Overhauser effects, and amide 
      exchange rates of native ShK toxin are compared with those of three synthetic 
      analogues with the substitutions Thr13 to Ala and Gln16 to Glu and Ala in order to 
      determine the contribution of this motif to the structure and stability of ShK 
      toxin. Disruption of the capping interactions destabilizes the helices, with the 
      Thr13 to Ala substitution being much more disruptive than Gln16 to Ala, consistent 
      with the lack of hydrogen bonding to the side chain of residue i + 4 in a class 4a 
      ST-motif. Mutation of residues 13 and 16 has only a minor effect on potassium 
      channel binding, probably because the disulfide bonding network minimizes the effect 
      of loss of the capping motif on the overall structure. The implications of these 
      findings for the design of ShK analogues are discussed.

PG  - 93-101
AB  - Using an indirect immunoperoxidase technique, the location of 
      gastrin-releasing/bombesin-like immunoreactive fibres and cell bodies in the cat 
      brainstem was studied. A moderate or low density of immunoreactive cell bodies was 
      observed in the nucleus of the brachium of the inferior colliculus, pericentral 
      nucleus of the inferior colliculus, ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus and in 
      the external division of the lateral reticular nucleus. The densest network of 
      immunoreactive fibres was visualized in the interpeduncular nucleus, marginal 
      nucleus of the brachium conjunctivum, alaminar and laminar spinal trigeminal nuclei 
      and in the substantia nigra. The periaqueductal gray, brachium of the inferior 
      colliculus, nucleus of the brachium of the inferior colliculus, locus coeruleus, 
      nucleus incertus, Kölliker-Fuse nucleus, facial nucleus, medial nucleus of the 
      solitary tract and the area postrema contained a moderate density of immunoreactive 
      fibres, whereas the pericentral nucleus of the inferior colliculus, nucleus sagulum, 
      cuneiform nucleus, dorsal nucleus of the raphe, superior central nucleus, central, 
      lateral and paralemniscal tegmental fields, ventral nucleus of the lateral 
      lemniscus, dorsal tegmental nucleus, postpyramidal nucleus of the raphe, nucleus 
      ambiguus, accessory dorsal tegmental nucleus, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and 
      the inferior olive had the lowest density of immunoreactive fibres.

TI  - Spectroscopic investigation of phenolic groups ionization in the vipoxin neurotoxic 
      phospholipase A2: comparison with the X-ray structure in the region of the tyrosyl 
      residues.
PG  - 239-44
AB  - The neurotoxin vipoxin is the major lethal component of the venom of Vipera 
      ammodites meridionalis, the most toxic snake in Europe. It is a complex between a 
      toxic phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and a non-toxic protein inhibitor (Inh). Tyrosyl 
      residues are involved in the catalytic site (Tyr 52 and 73) and in the substrate 
      binding (Tyr 22). Spectroscopic studies demonstrated differences in the ionization 
      behavior of the various phenolic hydroxyl groups in the toxic PLA2. The tyrosyl side 
      chains of the enzyme can be classified into three groups: (a) three phenolic 
      hydroxyls are accessible to the solvent and titrate normally, with a pKeff = 10.45; 
      (b) three residues are partially 'buried' and participate in hydrogen bonds with 
      neighboring functional groups. They titrate anomalously with a pKeff = 12.17; (c) 
      two tyrosines with a pKeff = 13.23 are deeply 'buried' in the hydrophobic interior 
      of PLA2. They became accessible to the titrating agent only after alkaline 
      denaturation of the protein molecule. The spectroscopic data are related to the 
      X-ray structure of the vipoxin PLA2. The refined model was investigated in the 
      region of the tyrosyl side chains. The accessible surface area of each tyrosyl 
      residue and each phenolic hydroxyl group was calculated. A good correlation between 
      the spectrophotometric and the crystallographic data was observed. The ionization 
      behavior of the phenolic groups is explained by peculiarities of the protein 
      three-dimensional structure and the participation of tyrosines in the catalytic site 
      hydrogen bond network. Attempts are made to assign the calculated pKeff values to 
      individual residues. The high degree of 'exposure' on the protein surface of Tyr 22 
      and 75 is probably important for their function as parts of the substrate binding 
      and pharmacological sites.

TI  - Fatal and severe box jellyfish stings, including Irukandji stings, in Malaysia, 
      2000-2010.
PG  - 275-81
LID - 10.1111/j.1708-8305.2011.00531.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Jellyfish are a common cause of injury throughout the world, with 
      fatalities and severe systemic events not uncommon after tropical stings. The 
      internet is a recent innovation to gain information on real-time health issues of 
      travel destinations, including Southeast Asia. METHODS: We applied the model of 
      internet-based retrospective health data aggregation, through the Divers Alert 
      Network Asia-Pacific (DAN AP), together with more conventional methods of literature 
      and media searches, to document the health significance, and clinical spectrum, of 
      box jellyfish stings in Malaysia for the period January 1, 2000 to July 30, 2010. 
      RESULTS: Three fatalities, consistent with chirodropid envenomation, were identified 
      for the period-all tourists to Malaysia. Non-fatal chirodropid stings were also 
      documented. During 2010, seven cases consistent with moderately severe Irukandji 
      syndrome were reported to DAN and two representative cases are discussed here. 
      Photographs of chirodropid (multi-tentacled), carybdeid (four-tentacled) box 
      jellyfish, and of severe sting lesions were also submitted to DAN during this 
      period. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the frequency and severity of 
      jellyfish stings affecting tourists in Southeast Asia have been significantly 
      underestimated. Severe and fatal cases of chirodropid-type stings occur in coastal 
      waters off Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah, Borneo. Indeed, the first Malaysian cases 
      consistent with Irukandji-like syndrome are reported here. Reports to DAN, a 
      provider of emergency advice to divers, offer one method to address the historic 
      lack of formalized reporting mechanisms for such events, for photo-documentation of 
      the possible culprit species and treatment advice. The application of marine stinger 
      prevention and treatment principles throughout the region may help reduce the 
      incidence and severity of such stings. Meanwhile travelers and their medical 
      advisors should be aware of the hazards of these stings throughout the Asia-Pacific.

TI  - Coordinated transitions in neurotransmitter systems for the initiation and 
      propagation of spontaneous retinal waves.
PG  - 6570-7
AB  - Spontaneous waves of excitation in the developing mammalian retina are mediated, to 
      a large extent, by neurotransmission. However, it is unclear how the underlying 
      neurotransmitter systems interact with each other to play specific roles in the 
      formation of retinal waves at various developmental stages. In particular, it is 
      puzzling why the waves maintain a similar propagation pattern even after underlying 
      neurotransmitter systems have undergone drastic developmental changes. Using Ca(2+) 
      imaging and patch clamp in a whole-mount preparation of the developing rabbit 
      retina, we discovered two dramatic and coordinated transitions in the excitatory 
      drive for retinal waves: one from a nicotinic to a muscarinic system, and the other 
      from a fast cholinergic to a fast glutamatergic input. Retinal waves before the age 
      of postnatal day 1 (P1) were blocked by nicotinic antagonists, but not by muscarinic 
      or glutamatergic antagonists. After P3, however, the spontaneous wave, whose basic 
      spatiotemporal pattern remained similar, was completely inhibited by muscarinic or 
      glutamate antagonists, but not by nicotinic antagonists. We also found that the 
      muscarinic drive, mediated primarily by M1 and M3 receptors, was particularly 
      important for wave propagation, whereas the glutamatergic drive seemed more 
      important for local excitation. Our results suggest (1) a novel mechanism by which a 
      neurotransmitter system changes its functional role via a switch between two 
      completely different classes of receptors for the same transmitter, (2) the 
      cholinergic system plays a critical role in not only early but also late spontaneous 
      waves, and (3) the continued participation of the cholinergic system may provide a 
      network basis for the consistency in the overall propagation pattern of spontaneous 
      retinal waves.

AB  - The localization of bombesin- (BOMB) and enkephalin- (ENK) immunoreactive (IR) 
      nerves was studied in rat coeliac-superior mesenteric ganglion complex in relation 
      to neuropeptide Y (NPY)- and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive neurons with 
      an immunofluorescence double-staining method. Very dense networks of BOMB-IR nerve 
      terminals surrounded the majority of the principal ganglion cells, whether or not 
      they were TH-IR. BOMB-IR nerves were specifically related to the non-NPY-IR neurons. 
      Moderately dense networks of ENK-IR fibers were unevenly distributed among the 
      ganglion cells. Majority of these neurons exhibited TH-IR and some of them also 
      contained NPY-IR. In sections double stained with antibodies to ENK and BOMB some 
      nerve fibers contained both peptides. The findings suggest that BOMB-IR nerves, 
      which have been previously demonstrated to originate from gut, control the function 
      of non-NPY-IR ganglion cells. ENK-IR nerves apparently control the adrenergic 
      neurons which project to gut and also some NPY-IR vasomotoric neurons. The finding 
      that ENK- and BOMB-IR coexist in some nerves suggests that some ENK-IR nerves may 
      originate from gut, although the major part probably represents preganglionic fibers 
      originating from spinal cord.

TI  - Differential blocking action of Joro spider toxin analog on parallel fiber and 
      climbing fiber synapses in cerebellar Purkinje cells.
PG  - 281-6
AB  - Synaptic potentials were recorded intracellularly from Purkinje cells in guinea pig 
      cerebellar slices. EPSPs evoked by stimulation of parallel fibers were effectively 
      blocked by perfusion of a slice with the synthetic analog of Joro spider toxin, 
      1-naphthylacetyl-spermine (NAS) at 250 microM. However, it did not influence those 
      responses evoked by stimulation of climbing fibers. This action of NAS is in 
      contrast to other commonly used glutamate antagonists, CNQX or APV: CNQX (5 microM) 
      blocked both parallel fiber- and climbing fiber-induced responses, while APV (up to 
      1 mM) did not influence either except for a weak reduction observed in climbing 
      fiber responses. NAS thus provides a useful tool for pharmacologically 
      distinguishing parallel fiber and climbing fiber synapses.

TI  - Electrical coupling and uncoupling of exocrine acinar cells.
PG  - 533-45
AB  - The electrical communication network in the mouse pancreatic acinar tissue has been 
      investigated using simultaneous intracellular recording with two separate 
      microelectrodes and direct microscopical control of the localizations of the 
      microelectrode tips. All cells within one acinus were electrically coupled, and the 
      coupling coefficient (the electrotonic potential change in a cell neighboring to the 
      cell into which current is injected [V2] divided by the electrotonic potential 
      change in the cell of current injection [V1]) between two cells near each other 
      (less than 50 micron) was always close to 1. Cells farther apart (50-100 micron) 
      were, in some cases, coupled; in other cases, there was no coupling at all. Coupling 
      coefficients varied between 0 and 1. There was rarely electrical coupling over 
      distances of more than 110 micron. Using microiontophoretic acetylcholine (ACh) 
      application, it was possible to evoke almost complete electrical uncoupling of two 
      previously coupled pancreatic or lacrimal acinar cells from different acini or 
      within one acinus. The effects were fully and quickly reversible. While the 
      ACh-evoked uncoupling in the pancreas was associated with membrane depolarization, 
      ACh caused hyperpolarization in the lacrimal acinar cells. The uncoupling was 
      associated with a very marked reduction in electrical time constant, indicating a 
      reduction in input capacitance (effective surface cell membrane area). The 
      concentrations of stimulants needed to evoke reduction in pancreatic cell-to-cell 
      coupling were 1 micron for ACh, 0.14 nM for caerulein, and 3 nM for bombesin. These 
      concentrations are smaller than those required to evoke maximal enzyme secretion.

TI  - Bombesin and platelet-derived growth factor induce association of endogenous focal 
      adhesion kinase with Src in intact Swiss 3T3 cells.
PG  - 28371-8
AB  - Stimulation of quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells with bombesin induces a rapid increase in 
      the formation of complexes between focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src family 
      members, which can be extracted with a buffer containing Triton, deoxycholate, and 
      SDS but not with a buffer containing Triton alone. An increase in complex formation 
      between FAK and Src in response to bombesin could be detected within 1 min, reached 
      a maximum after 10 min, and declined toward base-line levels after 60 min of 
      bombesin treatment. Bradykinin, endothelin, and lysophosphatidic acid also 
      stimulated FAK-Src complex formation. Bombesin stimulated FAK/Src association 
      through a Ca(2+) and phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase-independent pathway that 
      requires the integrity of the actin filament network and is partly dependent on 
      functional protein kinase C. Treatment with the selective Src kinase inhibitor PP-2 
      inhibited both FAK activation and phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr(577) induced by 
      bombesin in intact cells. Platelet-derived growth factor at low concentrations (1-10 
      ng/ml) also induced FAK-Src complex formation via a pathway that depended on the 
      integrity of the actin cytoskeleton and phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase. Thus, G 
      protein-coupled receptor agonists and platelet-derived growth factor promote complex 
      formation between endogenous FAK and Src in attached cells through different signal 
      transduction pathways.

TI  - A unique structural feature of a phospholipase A2 is probed by molecular dynamics.
PG  - 257-60
AB  - The unusual catalytic network, revealed by the crystal structure of one of the two 
      phospholipases A2 (PLA2) from the venom of the crotalid A.p.piscivorus has been 
      probed using molecular dynamics. The catalytic network has been remodeled to a 
      conformation similar to that found in all other PLA2, and the modeled structure has 
      been submitted to energy minimization and molecular dynamics simulation, to explore 
      the conformational space of the network. The calculations have yielded a large 
      reorganization of the catalytic network, which gets a conformation close to that of 
      the crystal structure. These results suggest that the unusual catalytic network 
      observed in the studied PLA2 is a structural feature of the protein and not a 
      crystal artifact.

TI  - Developmental regulation of small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel expression 
      and function in rat Purkinje neurons.
PG  - 4456-67
AB  - Calcium transients play an important role in the early and later phases of 
      differentiation and maturation of single neurons and neuronal networks. 
      Small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels of the SK type modulate 
      membrane excitability and are important determinants of the firing properties of 
      central neurons. Increases in the intracellular calcium concentration activate SK 
      channels, leading to a hyperpolarization of the membrane potential, which in turn 
      reduces the calcium inflow into the cell. This feedback mechanism is ideally suited 
      to regulate the spatiotemporal occurrence of calcium transients. However, the role 
      of SK channels in neuronal development has not been addressed so far. We have 
      concentrated on the ontogenesis and function of SK channels in the developing rat 
      cerebellum, focusing particularly on Purkinje neurons. Electrophysiological 
      recordings combined with specific pharmacological tools have revealed for the first 
      time the presence of an afterhyperpolarizing current (I(AHP)) in immature Purkinje 
      cells in rat cerebellar slices. The channel subunits underlying this current were 
      identified as SK2 and localized by in situ hybridization and subunit-specific 
      antibodies. Their expression level was shown to be high at birth and subsequently to 
      decline during the first 3 weeks of postnatal life, both at the mRNA and protein 
      levels. This developmental regulation was tightly correlated with the expression of 
      I(AHP) and the prominent role of SK2 channels in shaping the spontaneous firing 
      pattern in young, but not in adult, Purkinje neurons. These results provide the 
      first evidence of the developmental regulation and function of SK channels in 
      central neurons.

TI  - The Fc receptor gamma-chain is necessary and sufficient to initiate signalling 
      through glycoprotein VI in transfected cells by the snake C-type lectin, convulxin.
PG  - 2951-60
AB  - There is extensive evidence that FcR gamma-chain couples to the collagen receptor 
      glycoprotein VI (GPVI) and becomes phosphorylated on tyrosines upon receptor 
      cross-linking. However, it is not established whether this receptor complex is 
      sufficient to initiate the signalling cascade. We transfected GPVI and the FcR 
      gamma-chain into the human erythroleukaemia cell line K562, which lacks detectable 
      expression of GPVI and the FcR gamma-chain. The results show that GPVI is unable to 
      signal when expressed alone, despite its surface expression, upon stimulation with 
      the snake C-type lectin, convulxin. Coexpression of the FcR gamma-chain confers 
      signalling properties on the receptor. Furthermore, cotransfection of the FcR 
      gamma-chain and two mutant versions of GPVI shows that the transmembrane arginine 
      and cytoplasmic tail of GPVI are necessary for association with the FcR gamma-chain. 
      These results demonstrate that reconstitution of the GPVI-FcR gamma-chain complex in 
      cells expressing the necessary signalling network is sufficient to initiate 
      signalling events in response to convulxin and collagen-related peptide.

TI  - Pharmacological block of the electrogenic sodium pump disrupts rhythmic bursting 
      induced by strychnine and bicuculline in the neonatal rat spinal cord.
PG  - 17-23
AB  - The cellular mechanisms underlying rhythmic bursts induced in the isolated neonatal 
      rat spinal cord by bath application of strychnine and bicuculline (which block 
      glycine- and gamma-aminobutyric acid-A-receptor-mediated inhibition, respectively) 
      were probed with pharmacological tools. Such spontaneous bursts were recorded either 
      intracellularly from lumbar motoneurons or extracellularly from ventral roots. As 
      previously described, these network-driven events consisted of large-amplitude 
      depolarizations arising abruptly from baseline with a highly regular period (on 
      average 28 s). Burst episodes (lasting on average 7 s) comprised several 
      oscillations and appeared synchronously on flexor and extensor motoneuron pools of 
      both sides of the spinal cord. Their diffuse location made convenient to use 
      bath-applied substances in the attempt to selectively block distinct membrane 
      processes operating through the network. Application of apamin (0.4 microM) 
      shortened both cycle period and burst duration without changing their regular 
      rhythmicity. Similar results were obtained with carbachol (10 microM). Cs+ (4 mM) 
      reversibly hyperpolarized the motoneuron membrane potential and largely increased 
      burst duration, which was characterized by a long series of repetitive oscillatory 
      waves. Cycle period and rhythmicity remained unaltered. Ouabain (10 microM), 
      strophanthidin (4 microM), or K(+)-free solutions disrupted rhythmic bursting, which 
      was fragmented into irregularly occurring paroxysmal activity mixed with short 
      depolarizing events, still developing simultaneously on both sides of the spinal 
      cord. Bursting activity eventually ceased after approximately 30-40 min of 
      application of ouabain or strophanthidin. Prolonged washout of strophanthidin or 
      K(+)-free solutions reestablished regular bursting patterns, whereas no recovery 
      from ouabain was observed. At the time of strong depression of bursting, it was 
      still possible to evoke bursts by single electrical pulses applied to the segmental 
      dorsal root. Antidromic spikes of motoneurons could still be evoked by ventral root 
      stimulation. These results demonstrate that, in a spinal bursting network mainly 
      made up by excitatory processes, blockers of slow Ca(2+)-dependent K+ currents, such 
      as apamin or carbachol, or of the slow inward rectifier, such as Cs+, did not 
      suppress rhythmicity, suggesting that these conductances simply contributed to 
      control cycle period and/or burst duration. Conversely, pharmacological blockers of 
      the electrogenic Na+ pump such as ouabain, strophanthidin, or K(+)-free solutions 
      severely disrupted all characteristics of rhythmic bursting. It is proposed that the 
      operation of the electrogenic Na+ pump of premotoneurons was a crucial element for 
      rhythmic bursting.

TI  - Ca(2+) entry through L-type Ca(2+) channels helps terminate epileptiform activity by 
      activation of a Ca(2+) dependent afterhyperpolarisation in hippocampal CA3.
PG  - 297-306
AB  - In CA3 neurons of disinhibited hippocampal slice cultures the slow 
      afterhyperpolarisation, following spontaneous epileptiform burst events, was 
      confirmed to be Ca(2+) dependent and mediated by K(+) ions. Apamin, a selective 
      blocker of the SK channels responsible for part of the slow afterhyperpolarisation 
      reduced, but did not abolish, the amplitude of the post-burst 
      afterhyperpolarisation. The result was an increased excitability of individual CA3 
      cells and the whole CA3 network, as measured by burst duration and burst frequency. 
      Increases in excitability could also be achieved by strongly buffering intracellular 
      Ca(2+) or by minimising Ca(2+) influx into the cell, specifically through L-type 
      (but not N-type) voltage operated Ca(2+) channels. Notably the L-type Ca(2+) channel 
      antagonist, nifedipine, was more effective than apamin at reducing the post-burst 
      afterhyperpolarisation. Nifedipine also caused a greater increase in network 
      excitability as determined from measurements of burst duration and frequency from 
      whole cell and extracellular recordings. N-methyl D-aspartate receptor activation 
      contributed to the depolarisations associated with the epileptiform activity but 
      Ca(2+) entry via this route did not contribute to the activation of the post-burst 
      afterhyperpolarisation. We suggest that Ca(2+) entry through L-type channels during 
      an epileptiform event is selectively coupled to both apamin-sensitive and 
      -insensitive Ca(2+) activated K(+) channels. Our findings have implications for how 
      the route of Ca(2+) entry and subsequent Ca(2+) dynamics can influence network 
      excitability during epileptiform discharges.

TI  - On the mechanism of the gamma --> beta frequency shift in neuronal oscillations 
      induced in rat hippocampal slices by tetanic stimulation.
PG  - 1088-105
AB  - Tetanic stimulation of the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices can induce gamma 
      frequency population oscillations (30-100 Hz) after a latency of 50-150 msec that 
      are synchronized to within 1-2 msec when simultaneous stimuli are delivered to two 
      sites 2 mm or more apart. When tetanic stimuli, twice-threshold for eliciting gamma 
      oscillations, are used, new phenomena occur. (1) After a period of gamma, there is a 
      switch to beta frequencies (10-25 Hz); (2) during the switch, pyramidal cell spike 
      afterhyperpolarizations (AHPs) increase and rhythmic EPSPs occur in pyramidal cells; 
      and (3) after an episode of single-site, twice-threshold-induced gamma/beta 
      oscillations, simultaneous two-site threshold stimuli induce gamma oscillations that 
      are locally synchronized, but no longer are capable of long-range synchrony. We 
      studied the cellular mechanisms of the gamma/beta switch with electrophysiological 
      techniques and computer simulations. Our model predicts that the observed increases 
      in both pyramidal cell AHPs and in pyramidal/pyramidal cell EPSPs are necessary and 
      sufficient for the beta switch to occur. Firing patterns generated by the model, 
      both for pyramidal cells and for interneurons, resemble experimental records. A 
      one-site twice-threshold stimulus might lead to an inability of the two sites to 
      synchronize at gamma frequencies, after subsequent two-site stimulation, via this 
      mechanism. If depression is induced at synapses coupling pyramidal cells at one site 
      to interneurons at the other site, then two-site stimulation cannot produce 
      interneuron doublets; hence, as shown previously, the two sites will be unable to 
      synchronize. This mechanism works in simulations, and we provide experimental 
      evidence that synaptic depression and loss of doublets occur after a sufficiently 
      strong local tetanus to one site. We suggest that long-range excitatory connections 
      onto interneurons determine whether different pyramidal cell "assemblies" can 
      synchronize at gamma frequencies, whereas excitatory connections onto pyramidal 
      cells determine whether such assemblies can synchronize at beta frequencies.

TI  - Dendritic calcium spike initiation and repolarization are controlled by distinct 
      potassium channel subtypes in CA1 pyramidal neurons.
PG  - 8789-98
AB  - In CA1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus, calcium-dependent spikes occur in vivo 
      during specific behavioral states and may be enhanced during epileptiform activity. 
      However, the mechanisms that control calcium spike initiation and repolarization are 
      poorly understood. Using dendritic and somatic patch-pipette recordings, we show 
      that calcium spikes are initiated in the apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons 
      and drive bursts of sodium-dependent action potentials at the soma. Initiation of 
      calcium spikes at the soma was suppressed in part by potassium channels activated by 
      sodium-dependent action potentials. Low-threshold, putative D-type potassium 
      channels [blocked by 100 microM 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) and 0.5-1 microM 
      alpha-dendrotoxin (alpha-DTX)] played a prominent role in setting a high threshold 
      for somatic calcium spikes, thus restricting initiation to the dendrites. DTX- and 
      4-AP-sensitive channels were activated during sodium-dependent action potentials and 
      mediated a large component of their afterhyperpolarization. Once initiated, 
      repetitive firing of calcium spikes was limited by activation of putative BK-type 
      calcium-activated potassium channels (blocked by 250 microM tetraethylammonium 
      chloride, 70 nM charybdotoxin, or 100 nM iberiotoxin). Thus, the concerted action of 
      calcium- and voltage-activated potassium channels serves to focus spatially and 
      temporally the membrane depolarization and calcium influx generated by calcium 
      spikes during strong, synchronous network excitation.

TI  - Actin disruption inhibits bombesin stimulation of focal adhesion kinase (pp125FAK) 
      in prostate carcinoma.
PG  - 359-63
AB  - Jasplakinolide is a member of a new class of antitumor agents targeting the actin 
      cytoskeleton with activity against prostate cancer. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is 
      an actin-associated mediator of mitogenic peptides. We hypothesized that the 
      neuropeptide bombesin would activate FAR in prostate carcinoma, and that disruption 
      of the actin network would block FAK activation and inhibit cell growth. METHODS: 
      PC-3 human prostate carcinoma cells were exposed to 50-200 nM jasplakinolide (Jas) 
      or cytochalasin E (CyE) in cytotoxicity experiments. FAK phosphorylation was 
      measured in cells stimulated with 0.01-10 nM bombesin; separate cells were 
      pretreated 6 hr with 50-500 nM Jas or CyE. Cell lysates and anti-FAK 
      immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and detection with 
      anti-actin or anti-phosphotyrosine. Depolymerized G-actin was separated from total 
      actin by ultracentrifugation. Cytoskeletal changes were confirmed by fluorescence 
      microscopy. RESULTS: Jas (GI50 = 47 +/- 7 nM) and CyE (GI50 61 +/- 20 nM) potently 
      inhibited PC-3 growth (P < 0.01 vs control). Bombesin rapidly stimulated tyrosine 
      phosphorylation of FAK in a dose dependent manner. FAK phosphorylation was inhibited 
      to near-basal levels (50% of bombesin stimulated) by 500 nM Jas (63%) and 500 nM CyE 
      (61%). CONCLUSIONS: Bombesin stimulated FAK in prostate carcinoma cells. 
      Jasplakinolide, which induced over-polymerization of actin, and CyE, which 
      depolymerizes actin, both inhibited bombesin-stimulated phosphorylation of FAK and 
      inhibited PC-3 cell growth. Actin-disrupting agents block FAK signal transduction, 
      which may be critical to their antitumor activity in prostate carcinoma.

TI  - Abnormal axonal physiology is associated with altered expression and distribution of 
      Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 K+ channels after chronic spinal cord injury.
PG  - 491-506
AB  - Dysfunction of surviving axons which traverse the site of spinal cord injury (SCI) 
      has been linked to altered sensitivity to the K+ channel blocker 4-aminopyridine 
      (4-AP) and appears to contribute to post-traumatic neurological deficits although 
      the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, sucrose gap 
      electrophysiology in isolated dorsal column strips, Western blotting and confocal 
      immunofluorescence microscopy were used to identify the K+ channels associated with 
      axonal dysfunction after chronic (6-8 weeks postinjury) clip compresssion SCI of the 
      thoracic cord at T7 in rats. The K+ channel blockers 4-AP (200 microM, 1 mM and 10 
      mM) and alpha-dendrotoxin (alpha-DTX, 500 nM) resulted in a significant relative 
      increase in the amplitude and area of compound action potentials (CAP) recorded from 
      chronically injured dorsal column axons in comparison with control noninjured 
      preparations. In contrast, TEA (10 mM) and CsCl (2 mM) had similar effects on 
      injured and control spinal cord axons. Western blotting and quantitative 
      immunofluorescence microscopy showed increased expression of Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 K+ 
      channel proteins on spinal cord axons following injury. In addition, Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 
      showed a dispersed staining pattern along injured axons in contrast to a paired 
      juxtaparanodal localization in uninjured spinal cord axons. Furthermore, labelled 
      alpha-DTX colocalized with Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 along axons. These findings suggest a 
      novel mechanism of axonal dysfunction after SCI whereby an increased 4-AP- and 
      alpha-DTX-sensitive K+ conductance, mediated in part by increased Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 K+ 
      channel expression, contributes to abnormal axonal physiology in surviving axons.

TI  - Phospholipase A(2) activity of beta-bungarotoxin is essential for induction of 
      cytotoxicity on cerebellar granule neurons.
PG  - 213-23
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of the cytotoxic effect of 
      beta-bungarotoxin (beta-BuTX), a presynaptic neurotoxin, on rat cerebellar granule 
      neurons (CGNs). The maturation of CGNs is characterized by the prominent dense 
      neurite networks that became fragmented after treatment with beta-BuTX, and this 
      cytotoxic effect of beta-BuTX on CGNs was in a dose- and time-dependant manner. The 
      cytotoxic effect of beta-BuTX was found to be more potent than other toxins, such as 
      alpha-BuTX, cardiotoxin, melittin, and Naja naja atra venom phospholipase A(2). 
      Meanwhile, undifferentiated neuroblastoma neuronal cell lines, IMR-32 and SK-N-MC, 
      and astrocytes were found to be resistant to beta-BuTX. These results indicated that 
      only the mature CGNs were sensitive to beta-BuTX insults. None of the following 
      chemicals: antioxidants, K(+)-channel activator, K(+)-channel antagonists, 
      intracellular Ca(2+) chelator, Ca(2+)-channel blockers, NMDA receptor antagonists, 
      and nitric oxide synthase inhibitor tested, were able to reduce beta-BuTX-induced 
      cytotoxicity. However, secretory type phospholipase A(2) inhibitors (glycyrrhizin 
      and aristolochic acid) and a free radical scavenger (5,5-dimethyl pyrroline N-oxide, 
      DMPO) could attenuate not only beta-BuTX-induced cytotoxicity but also ROS 
      production and caspase-3 activation. These data suggest that phospholipase A(2) 
      activity of beta-BuTX may be responsible for free radical generation and caspase-3 
      activation that accounts for the observed cytotoxic effect. It is proposed that the 
      CGNs can be a useful tool for studying interactions of the molecules on neuronal 
      plasma membrane with beta-BuTX that mediates the specific cytotoxicity.

TI  - Non-charged amino acids from three different domains contribute to link agonist 
      binding to channel gating in alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.
PG  - 725-35
AB  - Binding of agonists to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors results in channel opening. 
      Previously, we have shown that several charged residues at three different domains 
      of the alpha7 nicotinic receptor are involved in coupling binding and gating, 
      probably through a network of electrostatic interactions. This network, however, 
      could also be integrated by other residues. To test this hypothesis, non-charged 
      amino acids were mutated and expression levels and electrophysiological responses of 
      mutant receptors were determined. Mutants at positions Asn47 and Gln48 (loop 2), 
      Ile130, Trp134, and Gln140 (loop 7), and Thr264 (M2-M3 linker) showed poor or null 
      functional responses, despite significant membrane expression. By contrast, mutants 
      F137A and S265A exhibited a gain of function effect. In all cases, changes in 
      dose-response relationships were small, EC(50) values being between threefold 
      smaller and fivefold larger, arguing against large modifications of agonist binding. 
      Peak currents decayed at the same rate in all receptors except two, excluding large 
      effects on desensitization. Thus, the observed changes could be mostly caused by 
      alterations of the gating characteristics. Moreover, analysis of double mutants 
      showed an interconnection between some residues in these domains, especially Gln48 
      with Ile130, suggesting a potential coupling between agonist binding and channel 
      gating through these amino acids.

TI  - Role of disulfide bonds in modulating internal motions of proteins to tune their 
      function: molecular dynamics simulation of scorpion toxin Lqh III.
PG  - 188-96
AB  - A series of 1-ns MD simulations were performed on the scorpion toxin Lqh III in 
      native and disulfide bond broken states. The removal of disulfide bonds has caused 
      hydrogen bond network alteration in the five-residue turn, the long loop, the 
      alpha-helix, the loop connecting strands II and III, and the C-terminal region. In 
      addition and more importantly, it has influenced the amplitude of the fluctuations 
      of five-residue turn, loops, and C-terminal region with a minor effect on the 
      fluctuations of the cysteines in the broken bond sites. These findings suggest that 
      disulfide bonds are not the most important factors in rigidifying their own 
      locations, while they have more important effects at a global scale. Furthermore, 
      our results reveal that disulfide bonds have considerable influence on the 
      functionally important essential modes of motions and the correlations between the 
      motions of the binding site residues. Therefore, we can conclude that disulfide 
      bonds have a crucial role in modulating the function via adjusting the dynamics of 
      scorpion toxin molecules. Although this conclusion cannot be generalized to all 
      peptides and proteins, it demonstrates the importance of more investigations on this 
      aspect of disulfide bond efficacy.

TI  - Treatment challenges and complications with ziconotide monotherapy in established 
      pump patients.
PG  - 147-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved Ziconotide 
      intrathecal infusion for the management of severe chronic pain in patients for whom 
      intrathecal therapy is warranted, and who are intolerant of, or refractory to, other 
      methods of treatment, including intrathecal morphine. Ziconotide is approved as a 
      monotherapy, but there are challenges associated with the decision to wean 
      intrathecal opioids for Ziconotide alone. Maintaining adequate analgesia and 
      managing opioid withdrawal symptoms may be difficult. Additionally, a variety of 
      adverse physiological, cognitive and psychiatric events may be associated with this 
      new drug. Patients with pretreatment psychiatric disorders may be at increased risk 
      for treatment complications. OBJECTIVE: To present a report of a case series 
      describing treatment challenges and complications associated with the decision to 
      convert established pump patients from intrathecal opioid therapy to Ziconotide 
      monotherapy. DESCRIPTION OF CASES: Three established pump patients, refractory to 
      intrathecal opioid therapy, were converted to Ziconotide monotherapy. All of these 
      patients experienced significant emotional distress or psychological symptoms that 
      threatened the success of the treatment. Achieving adequate analgesia, reducing 
      Ziconotide to mitigate adverse physiological effects, managing opioid withdrawal 
      symptoms, and supportive psychological consultation were combined to achieve 
      successful outcomes in two of our three patients. CONCLUSION: This report describes 
      challenges associated with the decision to convert established pump patients from 
      intrathecal opioid therapy to Ziconotide monotherapy. Inadequate analgesia, adverse 
      medication effects, and opioid withdrawal symptoms can precipitate a stressful 
      situation that may be perceived as dangerous or threatening by patients who are 
      predisposed to anxiety. Screening patients for psychiatric disorders, 
      anxiety-proneness and/or vulnerability to stress should be considered to reduce the 
      risk of treatment complications. A multimodal approach is strongly advocated, 
      including rapid responses of treating physicians and nurses along with strong 
      psychological support.

TI  - The refined crystal structure of dimeric phospholipase A2 at 2.5 A. Access to a 
      shielded catalytic center.
PG  - 9742-9
AB  - The 2.5-A crystal structure of the calcium-free form of the dimeric venom 
      phospholipase A2 from the Western Diamondback rattlesnake Crotalus atrox, has been 
      refined to an R-factor of 17.8% (I greater than 2 sigma) and acceptable 
      stereochemistry. The molecule is a nearly perfect 2-fold symmetric dimer in which 
      most of the catalytic residues of both subunits face an internal cavity. The 
      restricted access to the putative catalytic sites is especially puzzling as the 
      optimal substrates for this and most other phospholipase A2 are phospholipids 
      condensed in micellar or lamellar aggregates. We point out that substrate access to 
      the internal cavity may be aided by calcium binding which can alter the intersubunit 
      contacts that shield the catalytic network. We also suggest that a system of 
      hydrogen-bonded moieties exists on the surface of the dimer that links the amino 
      terminus to the catalytic system, through an invariant Gln 4 side chain and the 
      backbone of the active center residue, Tyr 73. This hydrogen-bonded network is on a 
      highly accessible surface of the dimer and would appear to contribute to the 
      enzyme's (as opposed to the proenzyme's) special capacity to attack aggregated 
      rather than monomeric substrate.

AB  - Ant species use branching networks of pheromone trails for orientation between nest 
      and resources. The current study demonstrated that workers of the venomous samsum 
      ant, Pachycondyla sennaarensis (Mayr) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Ponerinae), employ 
      recruitment trail pheromones discharged from the Dufour's gland. Secretions of other 
      abdomen complex glands, as well as hindgut gland secretions, did not evoke trail 
      following. The optimum concentration of trail pheromone was found to be 0.1 gland 
      equivalent/40 cm trail. This concentration demonstrated effective longevity for 
      about one hour. This study also showed that P. sennaarensis and Tapinoma simrothi 
      each respond to the trail pheromones of the other species as well as their own.

AB  - The authors present a summary of the proceedings and the recommendations of the 
      Fourth International Conference on Envenomations by Snakebites and Scorpion Stings 
      in Africa, held from 25 to 29 April 2011 in Dakar. After a two-day workshop for 
      Senegalese health personnel on the most relevant aspects of the management of 
      envenomations, about 270 participants met to share their experiences in the field. 
      Nearly a hundred oral and poster presentations were made on the epidemiology of 
      snakebites and scorpion stings in Africa, the composition and action of venoms and 
      the manufacture and use of antivenoms. The last day was devoted to an institutional 
      debate involving experts, representatives of national health authorities and 
      concerned professionals (physicians, pharmacists, nurses and traditional healers) as 
      well as members of the pharmaceutical industry to discuss and elaborate a set of 
      recommendations. It was agreed that it is necessary to improve knowledge of the 
      epidemiological situation by case reporting. Quality control of antivenoms and 
      procedures for their registration at the level of national health authorities should 
      aim at improving the distribution of safe and effective antivenoms in peripheral 
      health centers for the better assessment of victims. It was also recommended that 
      adequate training should be provided for health personnel in all aspects of medical 
      management of envenomations. Equitable distribution of funding and the establishment 
      of a network of African experts were also discussed in the conference.

TI  - A modified stasis thrombosis model to study the antithrombotic actions of heparin 
      and its fractions.
PG  - 155-75
AB  - The original stasis thrombosis model of Wessler has been modified. Numerous 
      thrombogenic agents were evaluated for their pathophysiologic effects and were 
      classified in terms of stasis clot in the jugular vein. Alterations produced in 
      coagulation parameters, such as the PT, APTT, thrombin time, activated 
      recalcification time (Hemachron), and thrombelastographic pattern were recorded. 
      Since the pathophysiologic activation of the hemostatic system varies considerably 
      in different diseases, a proper animal model along with a proper type of 
      thrombogenic trigger should be carefully selected to produce pathogenesis and to 
      study the therapeutic responses of heparin and its derivatives. In the modified 
      stasis thrombosis model, besides monitoring the formation of the jugular vein stasis 
      clot, it is proposed that the following tests may be useful to establish 
      hypercoagulable states: Functional levels of various coagulation factors, platelet 
      counts, fibrinogen levels, and whole blood activated clotting times. The nature of 
      activation processes in each thrombogenic challenge should be carefully analyzed in 
      terms of pathways involved; for example, the administration of heterologous serum 
      (such as human, monkey) to rabbits produces anaphylactoid reactions, including 
      hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, clinical chemistry abnormalities (enzymes), and many 
      problems that may involve the complement and immune systems. All previous data 
      obtained using heterologous sera as a thrombogenic trigger are of questionable value 
      as to the efficacy of some of the antithrombotic agents tested against it. In 
      addition to the species and the thrombogenic challenge, the following factors may 
      contribute significantly to the pathophysiologic response and its alteration by 
      various agents: (1) Composition of the thrombogenic agent; (2) effect of preparatory 
      drugs, such as anesthetics, on the hemostatic parameters; (3) alterations on 
      injection time, volume, osmolarity, and temperature; (4) variations in the 
      circulation time of the thrombogenic agent and stasis time of the ligated jugular 
      vein stasis segment; and (5) blood sample collection and handling. Since the 
      kallikrein-kinin cascade is closely associated with the coagulation and the 
      fibrinolytic network, a systemic monitoring of blood pressure may provide 
      information on the effect of thrombogenic agents on hemodynamics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED

TI  - The effects of Duvernoy's gland secretion from the xenodontine colubrid Philodryas 
      olfersii on striated muscle and the neuromuscular junction: partial characterization 
      of a neuromuscular fraction.
PG  - 459-66
AB  - The effect of Philodryas olfersii Duvernoy's secretion was studied in vivo in mice 
      and chicks as well as in the mouse phrenic nerve-diaphragm and the chick biventer 
      cervicis preparations. The whole secretion (20-40 micrograms/ml) increased the 
      creatine kinase (CK) levels in mice but had no effect on the mouse phrenic 
      nerve-diaphragm preparation. In the chick, the secretion caused head drop and 
      paresia as well as irreversible blockade of the twitch-tension evoked by indirect 
      stimulation in the chick biventer cervicis preparation (50% paralysis in 34.5 +/- 
      2.7 min, n = 4). The secretion also caused muscle contracture (30% of the maximal 
      twitch-tension generated) after a latency of nearly 9 min. Following fractionation 
      on a Superose 12 FPLC column, the neuromuscular activity was recovered in the high 
      mol. wt fraction (Peak I). At a concentration of 10 micrograms/ml in the chick 
      biventer cervicis preparation, Peak I caused 50% paralysis within 18.5 +/- 3.0 min 
      (n = 4), and evoked a strong contracture (70% of the maximal twitch-tension 
      generated). The contractile responses of the chick preparation to ACh and KCL were 
      partially blocked (90%) by the whole secretion and totally blocked by Peak I. CK 
      release was increased by the whole secretion but not by Peak I. The whole secretion 
      also produced various degrees of muscle cell lysis and extensive widening of the 
      intercellular spaces. The latter showed a loosely arranged membranous network. In 
      general, Peak I caused only minor morphological alterations compared with the whole 
      secretion, although these were still significantly different from those observed in 
      the control preparations. The changes principally involved hypercontraction of the 
      muscle fibers. Based on the above results, we conclude that Peak I contains the 
      factor(s) responsible for the in vitro effects on neuromuscular transmission, 
      whereas the direct myotoxic effect is apparently caused by at least one other 
      component of the Duvernoy's secretion.

TI  - Molecular dynamics simulations of phospholipases A2.
PG  - 163-70
AB  - An extensive molecular dynamics study of phospholipases A2 from pancreatic bovine 
      and Crotalus atrox venom has shown that the well-conserved homologous core of the 
      phospholipases A2, including the so called catalytic network, is very stable during 
      the course of the calculations. The fluctuations which occur are located in segments 
      which have significantly different three-dimensional conformations in the two 
      phospholipases A2 studied, suggesting that a particularly stable core conformation 
      gives rise to a large homologous family of similar three-dimensional structure. The 
      calcium ion, which exhibits a crucial structural role in the monomeric 
      phospholipases A2, appears not to be required to stabilize the C.atrox dimer. 
      Moreover, the behaviour of the dimeric structure during the dynamics raises the 
      question of a possible dissociation of the two subunits into functional monomers.

TI  - Stability of secondary structural elements in a solvent-free environment: the alpha 
      helix.
PG  - 165-70
AB  - The stability of the alpha helix as an element of secondary structure is examined in 
      the absence of solvation, in the gas phase. Mass-analyzed ion kinetic energy (MIKE) 
      spectrometry was applied to measure intercharge repulsion and intercharge distance 
      in multiply protonated melittin, a polypeptide known to possess a stable helical 
      structure in a number of different environments. The experimental results, 
      interpreted in combination with molecular mechanics calculations, suggest that 
      triply charged melittin retains its secondary structure in the gas phase. The 
      stability if the alpha-helical conformation of the polypeptide in the absence of 
      solvent molecules reflects the fact that a network of intrinsic helical hydrogen 
      bonds is energetically more favorable than unfolded conformations.

TI  - Differential effects of short and prolonged exposure to carvedilol on 
      voltage-dependent Na(+) channels in cultured bovine adrenal medullary cells.
PG  - 212-8
AB  - We examined the effects of short and prolonged exposure to carvedilol, an 
      antihypertensive and beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, on voltage-dependent Na(+) 
      channels in cultured bovine adrenal medullary cells. Carvedilol (1-100 microM) 
      reduced (22)Na(+) influx induced by veratridine, an activator of voltage-dependent 
      Na(+) channels. Carvedilol also suppressed veratridine-induced (45)Ca(2+) influx and 
      catecholamine secretion in a concentration-dependent manner similar to that of 
      (22)Na(+) influx. Prolonged exposure of the cells to 10 microM carvedilol increased 
      [(3)H]saxitoxin ([(3)H]STX) binding, which reached a plateau at 12 h and was still 
      observed at 48 to 72 h. Scatchard analysis of [(3)H]STX binding revealed that 
      carvedilol increased the B(max) value (control, 14.9 +/- 0.9 fmol/10(6) cells; 
      carvedilol, 23.8 +/- 1.2 fmol/10(6) cells) (n = 3, P < 0.05) without altering the 
      K(d) value, suggesting a rise in the number of cell surface Na(+) channels. The 
      increase in [(3)H]STX binding by carvedilol was prevented by cycloheximide, an 
      inhibitor of protein synthesis, whereas carvedilol changed neither alpha- nor 
      beta(1)-subunit mRNA levels of Na(+) channels. The carvedilol-induced increase of 
      [(3)H]STX binding was abolished by brefeldin A and H-89, inhibitors of intracellular 
      vesicular trafficking of proteins from the trans-Golgi network and of cyclic 
      AMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A), respectively. The present findings 
      suggest that short-term treatment with carvedilol reduces the activity of Na(+) 
      channels, whereas prolonged exposure to carvedilol up-regulates cell surface Na(+) 
      channels. This may add new pharmacological effects of carvedilol to our 
      understanding in the treatment of heart failure and hypertension.

TI  - Differential effects of bupivacaine enantiomers, ropivacaine and lidocaine on 
      up-regulation of cell surface voltage-dependent sodium channels in adrenal 
      chromaffin cells.
PG  - 175-84
AB  - In cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin cells, (+/-)-bupivacaine inhibited 
      veratridine-induced 22Na(+) influx (IC(50) 6.8 microM). The IC(50) of 
      (+)-bupivacaine (2.8 microM) was 6.2-, 7.4-, and 17.1-fold lower than those of 
      (-)-bupivacaine (17.3 microM), (-)-ropivacaine (20.6 microM), and lidocaine (47.8 
      microM). Chronic (i.e. 3-h) treatment of cells with (+/-)-bupivacaine increased cell 
      surface [3H]saxitoxin ([3H]STX) binding capacity by 48% (EC(50) of 233 microM; 
      t(1/2)=7.4 h), without changing the K(d) value. Treatment for 24 h with either (+)- 
      or (-)-bupivacaine, or (-)-ropivacaine elevated [3H]STX binding, whereas 24-h 
      treatment with lidocaine had no effect. The rise of [3H]STX binding by 
      (+/-)-bupivacaine was prevented by cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, 
      or brefeldin A, an inhibitor of cell surface vesicular exit from the trans-Golgi 
      network; however, (+/-)-bupivacaine did not increase Na(+) channel alpha- and 
      beta(1)-subunit mRNA levels. In cells subjected to (+/-)-bupivacaine treatment (1 mM 
      for 24 h) followed by 3-h washout, veratridine-induced 22Na(+) influx was enhanced, 
      even when measured in the presence of ouabain, an inhibitor of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase. 
      Ptychodiscus brevis toxin-3 potentiated veratridine-induced 22Na(+) influx by 
      2.3-fold in the (+/-)-bupivacaine-treated cells, as in non-treated cells. These 
      results suggest that lipophilic bupivacaine enantiomers or (-)-ropivacaine acutely 
      inhibit Na(+) channel gating, whereas its chronic treatment up-regulates cell 
      surface expression of Na(+) channels via translational and externalization events.

TI  - Trimeric G proteins modulate the dynamic interaction of PKAII with the Golgi 
      complex.
PG  - 3869-78
AB  - The Golgi complex represents a major subcellular location of protein kinase A (PKA) 
      concentration in mammalian cells where it has been previously shown to be involved 
      in vesicle-mediated protein transport processes. We have studied the factors that 
      influence the interaction of PKA typeII subunits with the Golgi complex. In addition 
      to the cytosol, both the catalytic (Calpha) and regulatory (RIIalpha) subunits of 
      PKAII were detected at both sides of the Golgi stack, particularly in elements of 
      the cis- and trans-Golgi networks. PKAII subunits, in contrast, were practically 
      absent from the middle Golgi cisternae. Cell treatment with either brefeldin A, 
      AlF(4-) or at low temperature induced PKAII dissociation from the Golgi complex and 
      redistribution to the cytosol. This suggested the existence of a cycle of 
      association/dissociation of PKAII holoenzyme to the Golgi. The interaction of 
      purified RIIalpha with Golgi membranes was studied in vitro and found not to be 
      affected by brefeldin A while it was sensitive to modulators of heterotrimeric G 
      proteins such as AlF(4-), GTPgammaS, beta(gamma) subunits and mastoparan. 
      RII(alphaa) binding was stimulated by recombinant, myristoylated Galpha(i3) subunit 
      and inhibited by cAMP. Pretreatment of Golgi membranes with bacterial toxins known 
      to catalyze ADP-ribosylation of selected Galpha subunits also modified RIIalpha 
      binding. Taken together the data support a regulatory role for Golgi-associated 
      Galpha proteins in PKAII recruitment from the cytosol.

AB  - We report a recent case of common adder (Vipera berus) envenoming causing paralytic 
      signs and symptoms. A 12-year-old girl was bitten by the nominate subspecies of the 
      common adder (V. berus berus) in eastern Hungary on May 2, 2012, 22 km away from 
      where the first neurotoxic V. berus berus envenoming was reported in 2008. The 
      patient developed unambiguous cranial nerve disturbances, manifested in bilateral 
      impairment characterized by oculomotor paralysis with partial ptosis, gaze paresis, 
      and diplopia. Drowsiness and photophobia were her additional symptoms; both occurred 
      only during the first day of envenoming. Until now among viper envenomings in 
      Europe, photophobia has only been documented by victims of Vipera aspis. Supportive 
      and symptomatic treatments were administered during 3 days of hospitalization. 
      Although case reports of V. berus berus envenomings are often published, clinical 
      experience with neurotoxicity by this subspecies still remains rare. 
      Population-based and geographic variation of venom composition in V. berus berus 
      seems to include neurotoxic envenomings in certain populations. This second 
      authenticated case provides new clinical evidence for the existence of a possible 
      neurotoxic V. berus berus population in a restricted geographical area in eastern 
      Hungary.

TI  - Influence of preformed alpha-helix and alpha-helix induction on the activity of 
      cationic antimicrobial peptides.
PG  - 81-8
AB  - One prominent class of cationic antibacterial peptides comprises the alpha-helical 
      class, which is unstructured in free solution but folds into an amphipathic 
      alpha-helix upon insertion into the membranes of target cells. To investigate the 
      importance of alpha-helicity and its induction on interaction with membranes, a 
      series of peptides was constructed based on a hybrid of moth cecropin (amino acids 
      1-8) and bee melittin (amino acids 1-18) peptides. The new peptides were predicted 
      to have a high tendency to form alpha-helices or to have preformed alpha-helices by 
      virtue of construction of a lactam bridge between glutamate and lysine side-chains 
      at positions i and i + 4 at various locations along the primary sequence. In two 
      examples where the use of lactam bridge constraints induced and stabilized 
      alpha-helical structure in benign (aqueous buffer) and/or hydrophobic medium, there 
      was a decrease in antibacterial activity relative to the linear counterparts. Thus 
      the preformation of alpha-helix in solution was not necessarily beneficial to 
      antimicrobial activity. In the one case where the lactam bridge did result in 
      increased antibacterial activity (lower minimal inhibitory concentration values) it 
      did not increase alpha-helical content in benign or hydrophobic medium. Broadly 
      speaking, good activity of the peptides against Pseudomonas aeruginosa correlated 
      best (r2 = 0.88) with a helican parameter which was calculated as the induction of 
      alpha-helix in a membrane-mimicking environment divided by the alpha-helix formation 
      under benign conditions. Interestingly, the activity of the lactam bridge peptide 
      constructs correlated in part with alterations in bacterial outer or cytoplasmic 
      membrane permeability.

TI  - Bombesin-like immunoreactivity in sympathetic ganglia.
PG  - 363-74
AB  - Nerve fibres showing immunoreactivity for bombesin have been observed in 
      prevertebral sympathetic ganglia of the rat and guinea-pig. The distribution of 
      bombesin immunoreactive fibres was compared with the distribution of the 
      structurally-related peptide substance P. Dense networks of varicose bombesin 
      immunoreactive fibres were observed, and in the rat coeliac ganglion the density 
      exceeded that of the substance P immunoreactive fibres. Extracts of rat and 
      guinea-pig coeliac ganglion contained material cross-reacting in radioimmunoassays 
      for bombesin tetradecapeptide. Similar concentrations of bombesin and substance P 
      were found in the guinea-pig ganglion, whereas in the rat the concentration of 
      bombesin was about 20 times as high as that of substance P. Two molecular forms of 
      immunoreactive bombesin were identified, neither of which corresponded exactly to 
      synthetic bombesin. The two components were also distinguishable from synthetic 
      substance P. A potential role of a bombesin-like peptide in neural pathways between 
      the gut and prevertebral ganglia is suggested.

TI  - Bombesin-induced pancreatic regeneration in pigs is mediated by p46Shc/p52Shc and 
      p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase upregulation.
PG  - 1310-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: In several animal species the pancreas has the capacity to partially 
      regenerate in a self regulating process. A complex network of growth factors 
      modulates this process. There is evidence that bombesin stimulates pancreatic 
      regeneration in rodents. Whether bombesin stimulates pancreas regrowth in large 
      mammals is unknown. Shc proteins, the target of tyrosine kinase-coupled receptors, 
      activate p42 and p44 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and induce the 
      transcriptional upregulation of genes involved in cell proliferation. The aims of 
      our study were to determine whether bombesin stimulates pancreatic growth in large 
      mammals and whether this event requires Shc-MAP kinase pathway upregulation. 
      METHODS: Three groups of pigs were submitted to sham operation (group 1); to 
      subtotal (70%) distal pancreatectomy (group 2), and to subtotal pancreatectomy 
      followed by bombesin (5 mg three times daily) for 4 weeks (group 3). After a 4-week 
      follow-up a second laparotomy was performed, and the residual pancreas removed. 
      p46Shc, p52Shc and p66Shc, Grb2, and p42/p44 MAP kinase expression and 
      phosphorylation were measured either in freshly isolated pancreatic acinar cells or 
      whole pancreatic extracts. RESULTS: In vivo bombesin administration resulted in: 1) 
      approximately 100% growth of pancreatic duodenal lobe; 2) rapid recovery from 
      exocrine pancreatic failure; and 3) a threefold increase in the rate of pancreatic 
      acinar cell proliferation. Incubating freshly isolated pancreatic acinar cells with 
      bombesin resulted in time- and concentration-dependent stimulation of p46Shc/p52Shc 
      phosphorylation, Shc-Grb2 complex formation, and p42/p44 MAP kinase activation. In 
      vivo bombesin administration significantly upregulated p46Shc/p52Shc and MAP kinase 
      expression and/or activity in whole pancreatic extracts. CONCLUSIONS: In vivo 
      chronic bombesin administration stimulates pancreatic regeneration after 
      pancreatectomy in large mammals. Bombesin-stimulated pancreatic growth is associated 
      with upregulation of the Shc-Grb2-SOS-Ras-MAP kinase pathway.

TI  - Bombesin stimulation of p125 focal adhesion kinase tyrosine phosphorylation. Role of 
      protein kinase C, Ca2+ mobilization, and the actin cytoskeleton.
PG  - 14261-8
AB  - Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) in quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells using either the 
      tumor promoter phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDB) or diacylglycerols increased the 
      tyrosine phosphorylation of p125 focal adhesion kinase (p125FAK) by 3.8-fold. PDB 
      stimulation of p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation was detected within 1 min and 
      reached a maximum within 5 min, considerably slower than PDB stimulation of 
      80K/MARCKS phosphorylation which was maximal within 1 min. In sharp contrast, 
      bombesin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK reached a maximum (8-fold 
      stimulation) within 1 min after addition of the peptide and occurred with a 
      half-maximal effect of 0.08 nM, 6-fold lower than the half-maximal effect of 
      bombesin on 80K/MARCKS phosphorylation. Down-regulation of PKC by prolonged 
      treatment with PDB blocked the effect of PDB on p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation but 
      had no effect on the response to bombesin. A selective inhibitor of PKC, GF 109203X, 
      markedly inhibited the stimulation of p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation by PDB but 
      had little effect on the response to bombesin, vasopressin, and endothelin. Bombesin 
      stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation could also be dissociated from mobilization 
      of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ pool by 
      treatment with the tumor promoter thapsigargin completely blocked the ability of 
      bombesin to transiently increase the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration but had no effect 
      on bombesin stimulation of p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast, 
      cytochalasin D, an agent which selectively disrupts the network of actin 
      microfilaments, completely inhibited bombesin- and PDB-induced p125FAK tyrosine 
      phosphorylation. Within the same concentration range (0.3-2 microM), the drug had no 
      effect on other early events stimulated by bombesin, including Ca2+ mobilization and 
      activation of PKC. These findings demonstrate that neither the PKC nor Ca2+ pathways 
      are responsible for the rapid stimulation of p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation by 
      neuropeptide growth factors. Furthermore, the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton is 
      essential for the effects of both PDB and bombesin.

      110,000-130,000 and M(r) 70,000-80,000 in Swiss 3T3 cells. Focal adhesion kinase 
      (p125FAK) and paxillin were identified as prominent substrates for SPC-stimulated 
      tyrosine phosphorylation. An increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK was 
      detected as soon as 30 s after SPC stimulation, reaching a maximum after 2.5 min. 
      SPC induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK in a concentration-dependent 
      fashion; a half-maximum effect occurred at 250 nM. Tyrosine phosphorylation of 
      p125FAK induced by SPC could be dissociated from both protein kinase C activation 
      and Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores. SPC induced a unique pattern of 
      reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton with a rapid appearance of actin 
      microspikes at the plasma membrane that was followed by the formation of actin 
      stress fibers. This pattern of cytoskeletal changes was clearly distinguishable from 
      that induced by bombesin and 1-oleoyl-lysophosphatidic acid. Formation of 
      microspikes and actin stress fibers were accompanied by striking assembly of focal 
      adhesion plaques. Cytochalasin D, which disrupts the network of actin 
      microfilaments, completely prevented SPC-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of 
      p125FAK. In addition, tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK was markedly inhibited in 
      the presence of platelet-derived growth factor at a concentration (30 ng/ml) that 
      disrupts actin stress fibers. Finally, microinjection of Clostridium botulinum C3 
      exoenzyme, which inactivates p21rho, prevented SPC-induced formation of actin stress 
      fibers, focal adhesion assembly, and tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, p21rho is 
      upstream of both cytoskeletal reorganization and tyrosine phosphorylation in 
      SPC-treated cells.

TI  - A monoclonal antibody interfering with binding and response of the acetylcholine 
      receptor.
PG  - 15746-54
AB  - Employing a monoclonal antibody raised against the receptor protein, we have probed 
      the mechanism of ligand interaction of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor from 
      Torpedo marmorata. Antibody WF6 specifically binds to alpha-subunits of the receptor 
      with a stoichiometry of one molecule per receptor monomer. At saturating 
      concentrations, WF6 blocks half of the binding sites for acetylcholine, all of the 
      binding sites for alpha-neurotoxins, and none of the binding sites for 
      representative cholinergic antagonists (with the exception of alpha-toxins) at the 
      receptor. In the presence of saturating concentrations of antibody WF6, 
      acetylcholine (or its agonists) cannot induce T1+ influx into Torpedo membrane 
      vesicles. Rapid oversaturation of the receptor by agonist also cannot overcome this 
      blockade of channel gating. The observed competition patterns of WF6 and 
      representative cholinergic ligands with the receptor are evidence for separate 
      binding sites for groups of ligands and for a network of allosterically linked 
      effector regions at the receptor. The blockade by saturating concentrations of WF6 
      of the agonist-induced channel gating supports the conclusion that two molecules of 
      agonist are required to activate the receptor-integral ion channel.

TI  - Role of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid in the calcium-induced structural transition of 
      conantokin G, a conotoxin from the marine snail Conus geographus.
PG  - 15677-84
AB  - Conantokin G is a gamma-carboxyglutamic acid- (Gla-) containing conotoxin isolated 
      from the venom of the marine cone snail Conus geographus. This 17-residue 
      polypeptide, which contains five gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues, is a 
      N-methyl-d-aspartate- (NMDA-) type glutamate receptor antagonist. To investigate the 
      role of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid in the calcium-induced structural transition of 
      conantokin G, we determined the three-dimensional structure of the conantokin G/Ca2+ 
      complex by two-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy and compared it to the 
      high-resolution structure of conantokin G in the absence of metal ions [Rigby et al. 
      (1997) Biochemistry 36, 6906]. Complete resonance assignments were made by two 
      dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy at pH 5.6 in the presence of saturating amounts of 
      Ca2+. Distance geometry and simulated annealing methods were used to derive 23 
      convergent structures from a set of 302 interproton distance restraints and two 
      torsion angle measurements. A high-resolution structure, with the backbone root mean 
      square deviation to the geometric average of the 23 structures of 0.6 +/- 0.1 A, 
      contains a linear alpha-helix from Gla 3 to Lys 15. Gla residues 3, 7, 10, and 14 
      are aligned in a linear array on one face of the helix. A genetic algorithm was 
      applied to determine the calcium positions in conantokin G, and the conantokin 
      G/Ca2+ complex refined by molecular simulation. Upon binding of Ca2+ to 
      gamma-carboxyglutamic acid, conantokin G undergoes a conformational transition from 
      a distorted curvilinear 310 helix to a linear alpha-helix. Occupancy of the metal 
      binding sites, defined by gamma-carboxyglutamic acids, results in formation of a 
      calcium-carboxylate network that linearizes the helix and exposes the hydrophobic 
      amino acids on the opposite face of the helix.

TI  - Enhancement of persistent Na+ current by sea anemone toxin (ATX II) exerts dual 
      action on hippocampal excitability.
PG  - 2387-96
AB  - We used anemone toxin II (ATX II) to study how a selective enhancement of persistent 
      Na+ current (INaP) would affect the excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons in the 
      hippocampal slice. In whole-cell recordings from CA1 cell somata, local application 
      of ATX II (10 microM) into the stratum pyramidale invariably depolarized the neurons 
      and produced sustained burst discharges with depolarizing plateau potentials of 
      variable amplitude and length. However, the strong excitatory action of ATX II, 
      observed on the single cell level, was not mirrored in field potential recordings 
      from the same hippocampal subfield. The amplitude of the electrically evoked 
      population spike declined, reflecting the decreased availability of fast Na+ 
      channels, and the intracellulary recorded burst discharges were not detected by the 
      field electrode. The lacking synchronization of cellular bursting activity was seen 
      during both local and bath application of ATX II, suggesting that the toxin, in 
      addition to promoting burst discharges of individual neurons, simultaneously dampens 
      network excitability. In fact, ATX II reduced afferent fibre volleys (reflecting 
      axonal excitability) and field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in a 
      similar fashion. As the expression of different Na+ channel subtypes appears to be 
      compartmentalized within hippocampal neurons, we propose that point mutations 
      leading to pathologically enhanced INaP might exert quite opposite effects, 
      depending on the type and location of the Na+ channel affected. Whereas alterations 
      of somatodendritic Na+ channels would give rise to bursting activity, alterations of 
      axonal Na+ channels would primarily decrease network excitability.

TI  - Human growth hormone co-transfection assay to study molecular mechanisms of 
      neurosecretion in PC12 cells.
PG  - 267-72
AB  - The recent introduction of transient co-transfection assays, with human growth 
      hormone (hGH) as a marker of transfection, has allowed us to study the function of 
      transfected proteins in neurosecretion using intact PC12 cells and adrenal 
      chromaffin cells [J. Biol Chem. 268 (1993) 10983]. Since this assay requires several 
      non-trivial steps (transfection of the genes, triggering of secretion, and 
      measurement of hGH), care should be taken before attributing any observed effect to 
      the transfected proteins. In this article, we describe a detailed procedure for the 
      hGH transfection assay and show that this approach can be used to study the 
      molecular events involved in neurosecretion.

TI  - Kinetics of phosphate incorporation into adenosine triphosphate and guanosine 
      triphosphate in bacteria.
PG  - 1113-23
AB  - Escherichia coli cells were labeled with (33)PO(4) for several generations and then 
      (32)PO(4) was added, samples were taken at various times, and adenosine triphosphate 
      (ATP) and guanosine triphosphate (GTP) were purified from an acid extract. The ratio 
      of (32)P/(33)P in each of the six phosphate species was determined and compared to 
      the ratio expected at isotopic steady state. The rate constants of the simplest 
      network of pools which could explain the data, and were consistent with metabolic 
      pathways, were then calculated. In the range of times studied (30 to 3,000 s at 21.5 
      C) the following generalizations can be made. (i) The gamma-phosphate at ATP 
      requires 2,200 s to achieve 50% of its final specific activity and behaves as if it 
      were exchanging with another species 4.4 times as large, with this other species 
      turning over in 540 s. (ii) The beta-phosphate of ATP and the gamma-phosphate of GTP 
      are in equilibrium with the gamma-phosphate of ATP. (iii) The specific activity of 
      the gamma-phosphate of GTP lags 66 s behind the gamma-phosphate of ATP. (iv) The 
      alpha-phosphates of ATP and GTP have equal specific activities which lag far behind 
      the other four phosphates. A single precursor pool with a turnover time of 416s fits 
      the data best, although a fair fit can be obtained assuming several sequential 
      precursor pools with much shorter turnover times. These findings are consistent with 
      known biosynthetic pathways and the probable flows through them, including the 
      relationship of nucleotide biosynthesis to ribonucleic acid synthesis and turnover.

TI  - Voltage-activated calcium currents in rat retinal ganglion cells in situ: changes 
      during prenatal and postnatal development.
PG  - 3486-94
AB  - Voltage-activated calcium currents (ICa) are one way by which calcium influx into 
      neurons is mediated. To investigate changes in kinetic properties of ICa during 
      neuronal development and to correlate possible kinetic changes with specific 
      differentiation processes, the ICa of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) was recorded 
      with the perforated patch-clamp technique in rat retinal slices and in whole mounts 
      at different prenatal and postnatal stages. ICa density increased between embryonic 
      day (E) 20 and the adult stage, paralleled by a shift in activation of the 
      omega-conotoxin GVIA-sensitive ICa toward more negative membrane potentials. 
      Furthermore, developmental alterations were observed in ICa inactivation rate during 
      a 120 msec test pulse and in steady-state inactivation of ICa. The most striking 
      feature in ICa kinetics was a transient slowing of calcium current deactivation, 
      which peaked at postnatal day (P)3-5 and affected all ICa subtypes. Although the 
      shift in activation and the decreased inactivation rate of ICa can be explained by 
      differential regulation of distinct calcium channel subtypes, it is more likely that 
      a more general alteration of the cells' functional state was the underlying factor 
      in alterations in steady-state inactivation and current deactivation of ICa. 
      Alterations in the omega-conotoxin GVIA-sensitive and the toxin-resistant currents 
      temporarily coincide with dendritic differentiation, and it is tempting to speculate 
      about their role in network formation in the inner retina. In contrast, alterations 
      in steady-state inactivation and current deactivation may be involved in the 
      regulation of RGC survival, because they occur during the period of programmed cell 
      death in the ganglion cell layer. In conclusion, distinct time windows of 
      alterations in calcium channel properties were found, and this study has provided a 
      basis for performing functional assays to clarify in detail the developmental 
      process to which these alterations are related.

TI  - Protein kinase C-alpha and -epsilon down-regulate cell surface sodium channels via 
      differential mechanisms in adrenal chromaffin cells.
PG  - 1674-84
AB  - In cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin cells, our [3H]saxitoxin ([3H]STX) binding, 
      immunoblot, and northern blot analyses specified protein kinase C (PKC) 
      isoform-specific posttranscriptional and posttranslational mechanisms that direct 
      down-regulation of cell surface Na channels. Immunoblot analysis showed that among 
      11 PKC isoforms, adrenal chromaffin cells contained only conventional (c)PKC-alpha, 
      novel (n)PKC-epsilon, and atypical (a)PKC-zeta. Treatment of adrenal chromaffin 
      cells with 100 nM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) or 100 nM phorbol 
      12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) caused a rapid (<15 min) and sustained (>15 h) translocation 
      of PKC-alpha and -epsilon (but not -zeta) from cytosol to membranes, whereas a 
      biologically inactive 4alpha-TPA had no effect. Thymeleatoxin (TMX), an activator of 
      cPKC, produced similar membrane association of only PKC-alpha at 100 nM, with the 
      potency of TMX being comparable with those of TPA and PDBu. Treatment with either 
      100 nM TPA or 100 nM TMX reduced cell surface [3H]STX binding to a comparable extent 
      at 3, 6, and 12 h, whereas TPA lowered the binding to a greater extent than TMX at 
      15, 18, and 24 h; at 15 h, Gö6976, a specific inhibitor of cPKC, completely blocked 
      TMX-induced decrease of [3H]STX binding while preventing by merely 57% TPA-induced 
      decrease of [3H]STX binding. Treatment with 100 nM TPA lowered the Na channel 
      alpha-subunit mRNA level between 3 and 12 h, with its maximum 52% fall at 6 h, and 
      it was accompanied by a subsequent 61 % rise of the beta1-subunit mRNA level at 24 
      h. Gö6976 failed to prevent TPA-induced reduction of the alpha-subunit mRNA level; 
      TMX did not change the alpha- and beta1-subunit mRNA levels throughout the 24-h 
      treatment. Brefeldin A, an inhibitor of vesicular exit from the trans-Golgi network, 
      augmented TPA- and TMX-induced decrease of [3H]STX binding at 1 and 3 h. Our 
      previous and present studies suggest that PKC down-regulates cell surface Na 
      channels without altering the allosteric gating of Na channels via PKC 
      isoform-specific mechanisms; cPKC-alpha promotes Na channel internalization, whereas 
      nPKC-epsilon decreases the alpha-subunit mRNA level by shortening the half-life of 
      alpha-subunit mRNA without changing its gene transcription.

TI  - 1H-n.m.r. study of the solution properties and secondary structure of neurotoxin III 
      from the sea anemone Anemonia sulcata.
PG  - 545-51
AB  - The solution properties, secondary structure and global fold of the 27-residue 
      polypeptide neurotoxin III (ATX III), from the sea anemone Anemonia sulcata, have 
      been investigated using high-resolution 1H-n.m.r. spectroscopy. Studies of the 
      concentration dependence of the n.m.r. spectrum indicate that the molecule 
      self-associates in the millimolar concentration range useable for n.m.r. analysis, 
      the association being less pronounced at acidic pH values. The dependence on pH of 
      association implies that electrostatic interactions play a role in this process, 
      while the significant concentration-dependent shifts of the aromatic resonances of 
      Tyr-7 and Trp-13 indicate that hydrophobic interactions also contribute. Individual 
      pKa values have been determined for most ionizable groups in the molecule. 
      Sequence-specific resonance assignments were obtained for all protons using a range 
      of two-dimensional homonuclear-correlated and nuclear-Overhauser-effect (nOe) 
      spectra. The secondary structure of the polypeptide was identified from sequential 
      (i, i+1) and medium-range (i, i+2/3/4) nOe connectivities, NH to C alpha H coupling 
      constants, C alpha H chemical shifts, and the location of slowly exchanging 
      backbone-amide protons. ATX III contains no regular alpha-helix or beta-sheet, 
      consisting instead of a network of reverse turns. nOe connectivities between 
      half-cystine residues are consistent with the disulphide pairings 3-17, 4-11 and 
      6-22. ATX III has a well-defined structure and appears to lack the disordered loop 
      which, in the longer sea anemone toxins (46-49 residues), may be part of the 
      receptor-binding surface.

TI  - Metaphit-induced audiogenic seizures in mice: II. Studies on N-methyl-D-aspartic 
      acid, GABA, and sodium channel receptors and on the disposition of metaphit in the 
      brain.
PG  - 211-9
AB  - We previously demonstrated that metaphit (a phencyclidine analogue with an acylating 
      isothiocyanate group) induces occurrence of audiogenic seizures in mice exposed to 
      audio stimulation 24 h after metaphit administration. We have studied various 
      receptor systems associated with excitatory and inhibitory networks: sites for 
      competitive and noncompetitive antagonists of the N-methyl D-aspartic acid (NMDA) 
      receptor complex, for [3H]muscimol on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor 
      complex, and for [3H]batrachotoxinin A20-alpha-benzoate on the voltage-dependent 
      sodium channel. Mice were examined for neurochemical changes at 24 h after 
      pretreatment with metaphit, when susceptibility to audiogenic seizures is greatest. 
      Ex vivo receptor binding studies detected no changes; in vivo labeling of the 
      phencyclidine site in the NMDA receptor complex was reduced by 20% in cortical and 
      midbrain regions. A separate group of experiments was aimed at measuring brain 
      levels of metaphit. One minute after retroorbital administration of [3H]metaphit at 
      a dose sufficient to produce susceptibility to audiogenic seizures 24 h later, the 
      brain level of [3H]metaphit (determined by high-performance liquid chromatography, 
      HPLC) was 49 pmol/mg tissue; at 1, 4, and 24 h, the level was 12, 6, and 1.4 pmol/mg 
      tissue or microM if metaphit was evenly distributed throughout the brain. Although 
      the observed metaphit concentrations during the first 4 h are high enough to acylate 
      receptors, no firm evidence for acylation was found for most of the examined 
      receptors. Finally, the time course of the brain level of metaphit showing a 
      continuous decrease is entirely different from that of development of the seizure 
      susceptibility, which peaks at 18-24 h.

TI  - Fibrinogen Chapel Hill: hypodysfibrinogenemia with a tertiary polymerization defect.
PG  - 23-38
AB  - A patient with a functionally defective fibrinogen (fibrinogen Chapel Hill) has been 
      investigated. Fibrinogen Chapel Hill is characterized by hypofibrinogenemia, with a 
      plasma concentration about one third of normal, as measured both functionally and 
      immunochemically. Fibrinogen survival is normal; so also is fibrinopeptide release. 
      A polymerization defect in this fibrinogen results in the delay of fibrin fibrils in 
      solution to form a normal three-dimensional gel. This defect is not associated with 
      end-to-end aggregation or with lateral associations in solution. Delayed gelation 
      results from an abnormality in a tertiary contact site involved in network 
      branching, which is associated with the hydrophilic, carboxy-terminal segment of the 
      alpha chain. Fibrinogen Chapel Hill exhibits two additional abnormal responses, 
      which are also associated with the same region. The early plasmin cleavages of 
      fibrinogen and fragment X are delayed, and there is a concomitant delay in the 
      appearance of fragments Y, D, and E. This fibrinogen also has an unusual sensitivity 
      to Ancrod proteolysis, whereby Ancrod cleaves a large carboxy-terminal segment of 
      the alpha chain more rapidly than in normal fibrinogen. The abnormalities in 
      fibrinogen Chapel Hill can be explained by a structural abnormality which is 
      functionally related to an alpha chain associated polymerization domain.

TI  - The role of cholinergic networks of the anterior basal and inferior frontal lobes in 
      the predatory behaviour of Sepia officinalis.
PG  - 267-74
AB  - The predatory behaviour of the cuttlefish has been the subject of a few detailed 
      studies and can be divided into several stages: prey detection, orientation, 
      positioning, prey-seizing, prey-manipulation and ingestion. Nevertheless, the data 
      about its control by the CNS remain fragmentary. By injecting a cholinergic agonist 
      (nicotine) and antagonists (alpha-bungarotoxin, mecamylamine), the implication of 
      cholinergic networks of the anterior basal and inferior frontal lobes in the control 
      of predatory behaviour are demonstrated. Through these cholinergic networks, the 
      anterior basal lobe takes an important part in the orientation and positioning. The 
      inferior frontal lobe seems to play a role in the control of brachial manipulative 
      and buccal mass activities. The implication of cholinergic networks of the anterior 
      basal and inferior frontal lobes in the predatory behaviour and the pharmacology of 
      nicotinic receptors are discussed.

TI  - Mutations on N-terminal region of Taiwan cobra phospholipase A(2) result in 
      structurally distorted effects.
PG  - 890-7
LID - 10.1002/psc.1020 [doi]
AB  - In the present study, three Taiwan cobra PLA(2) variants were prepared by adding an 
      extra N-terminal Met, substituting Asn-1 by Met or deleting the N-terminal 
      heptapeptide. Recombinant PLA(2) mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli (E. 
      coli), and purified to homogeneity by reverse phase HPLC. Fluorescence measurement 
      showed that the hydrophobic character of the catalytic site, the microenvironment of 
      Trp residues and energy transfer from excited Trp to 8-anilinonaphthalene sulfonate 
      (ANS) were affected by N-terminal mutations. An alteration in the structural 
      flexibility of the active site was noted with the mutants lacking the N-terminal 
      heptapeptide or with an extra N-terminal Met added as evidenced by the inability of 
      the two variants to bind with Ba(2+). Moreover, modification of Lys residues and 
      energy transfer within the protein-ANS complex revealed that the Ca(2+)-induced 
      change in the global structure of PLA(2) was different from that in N-terminal 
      variants. Together with the fact that an 'activation network' connects the 
      N-terminus with the active site, our data suggest that mutagenesis on the N-terminal 
      region affects directly the fine structure of the catalytic site, which subsequently 
      transmits its influence in altering the structure outside the active site of PLA(2).

      p130(cas)-Crk complex.
PG  - 9363-70
AB  - Treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with bombesin rapidly induced tyrosine phosphorylation 
      of the p130 Crk-associated substrate (p130(cas)). Vasopressin, endothelin, 
      bradykinin, lysophosphatidic acid, sphingosylphosphorylcholine, and phorbol 
      12,13-dibutyrate also stimulated p130(cas) tyrosine phosphorylation. 
      Bombesin-induced p130(cas) tyrosine phosphorylation could be dissociated from both 
      protein kinase C activation and Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores. In 
      contrast, cytochalasin D, which disrupts the network of actin microfilaments, 
      completely prevented tyrosine phosphorylation of p130(cas) by bombesin. 
      Platelet-derived growth factor, at low concentrations (1-5 ng/ml), also induced 
      tyrosine phosphorylation of p130(cas) via a pathway that depended on the integrity 
      of the actin cytoskeleton. The phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase inhibitors wortmannin 
      and LY294002 prevented tyrosine phosphorylation of p130(cas) in response to 
      platelet-derived growth factor but not in response to neuropeptides, 
      lysophosphatidic acid, sphingosylphosphorylcholine, or phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. All 
      agonists that induced p130(cas) tyrosine phosphorylation also promoted the formation 
      of a p130(cas).Crk complex in intact Swiss 3T3 cells. Thus, our results identified 
      distinct signal transduction pathways that lead to tyrosine phosphorylation of 
      p130(cas) in the same cells and suggest that p130(cas) could play a role in 
      mitogen-mediated signal transduction.

TI  - Peptide immunoreactive nerves and cells of the guinea pig gall bladder and biliary 
      pathways.
PG  - 1186-93
AB  - Using the methods of immunocytochemistry and radioimmunoassay, five peptides 
      (vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), substance P, somatostatin, met-enkephalin, 
      and bombesin) have been found in the gall bladder and the biliary tracts of guinea 
      pig and each of them possesses a characteristic distribution pattern. Networks of 
      nerves containing each peptide were found in the smooth muscle, around blood vessels 
      and, occasionally, in the lamina propria. The distribution of the peptide 
      immunoreactive nerves in the gall bladder and biliary tract is similar to those 
      found in the gut. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (11 +/- 1.5 pmol/g in the 
      sphincters, mean +/- SEM) and substance P (21.5 +/- 1.8 pmol/g in the common bile 
      duct) were found to be the most abundant peptides and a few VIP and substance P 
      immunoreactive neurones were localised in the ganglionated plexus. Bombesin 
      immunoreactive nerves were mainly seen in the sphincter of Oddi, where the mean 
      concentration of extractable bombesin was 14.6 +/- 2 pmol/g. Somatostatin 
      immunoreactive mucosal endocrine cells were identified in the epithelium of the 
      common bile duct and the sphincter. The extractable somatostatin in these regions 
      were 76 +/- 19 pmol/g and 162 +/- 30 pmol/g respectively.

TI  - Up-regulation of cell surface sodium channels by cyclosporin A, FK506, and rapamycin 
      in adrenal chromaffin cells.
PG  - 657-65
AB  - Treatment of cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin cells with cyclosporin A (CsA) 
      increased cell surface [(3)H]saxitoxin ([(3)H]STX) binding by 56% in a time (t(1/2) 
      = 15.2 h)- and concentration (EC(50) = 2.9 microM)-dependent manner but did not 
      change the K(d) value. In CsA-treated cells, veratridine-induced (22)Na(+) influx 
      was augmented with no change in the EC(50) of veratridine; also, alpha- and 
      beta-scorpion venom and Ptychodiscus brevis toxin-3 enhanced veratridine-induced 
      (22)Na(+) influx in a more than additive manner, as in nontreated cells. CsA 
      treatment for 1 to 24 h inhibited calcineurin activity, measured by the in vitro 
      assay, with the IC(50) of 0.6 microM but did not alter cellular level of 
      calcineurin. FK506 or rapamycin elevated [(3)H]STX binding by 36 or 25%, whereas 
      GPI-1046, an immunophilin ligand incapable to inhibit calcineurin, or okadaic acid, 
      an inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, had no increasing effect. The rise of 
      [(3)H]STX binding by CsA was attenuated by the coincident treatment with brefeldin A 
      (BFA), an inhibitor of vesicular exit from the trans-Golgi network. The 
      internalization rate of cell surface Na(+) channels, as determined in the presence 
      of BFA, was decreased in CsA (but not rapamycin)-treated cells (t(1/2) = 20.3 h), 
      compared with nontreated cells (t(1/2) = 13.7 h). CsA treatment, however, did not 
      elevate cellular levels of Na(+) channel alpha-subunit and Na(+) channel alpha- and 
      beta(1)-subunit mRNAs. In CsA-treated cells, veratridine-induced (45)Ca(2+) influx 
      via voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels and catecholamine secretion were enhanced, 
      whereas high K(+)-induced (45)Ca(+) influx was not. Thus, the inhibition of 
      calcineurin or rapamycin-binding protein causes up-regulation of cell surface 
      functional Na(+) channels via modulating externalization and internalization of 
      Na(+) channels, thus enhancing Ca(2+) channel gating and catecholamine secretion.

TI  - Determination of the disulphide bonding pattern in proteins by local and global 
      analysis of nuclear magnetic resonance data. Application to flavoridin.
PG  - 897-906
AB  - This paper describes a new method for the elucidation of the disulphide bonding 
      pattern in a protein from an initial set of unrefined nuclear magnetic resonance 
      solution structures. The use of both local and global proton-proton nuclear 
      Overhauser enhancement (NOE) distance information for the identification of the 
      disulphide bridge network in cysteine-rich polypeptides was investigated by 
      statistical analysis of the crystal structures of a selected group of proteins. 
      There are six different types of inter-cysteine proton-proton distances which can 
      potentially be used for the prediction of disulphide links. The uniqueness and the 
      extent to which disulphide bonds could be identified by these distances was 
      evaluated. Only NOEs between C beta H/C beta H and C alpha H/C beta H were shown to 
      have positive predictive values for the characterization of disulphide links. 
      Contrarily, the observation of an NOE between C alpha H and NH is a strong 
      indication for the absence of a disulphide bridge between the two residues. The 
      global analysis of the nuclear magnetic resonance data starts with the calculation 
      of an initial set of conformers. First, pairing weights wij were assigned to all 
      putative cysteine pairs in the protein according to a Gaussian-type distribution 
      function from the C beta-C beta interatomic distances. In a second step, all 
      conceivable disulphide patterns were formed by an exhaustive combinatorial 
      enumeration. Statistical weights were then assigned to all patterns from the weights 
      of the participating cysteine pairs. This method was validated with protein crystal 
      structures deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank having three or more 
      cysteine residues. It was then used to determine the previously unknown disulphide 
      bonding pattern of the 12 cysteine residues of flavoridin.

TI  - Immunohistochemical localisation of a gastrin-releasing peptide-like material in 
      area postrema, nucleus of the solitary tract and vagal motor nucleus in the 
      brainstem of rat.
PG  - 97-104
AB  - The presence of an endogenous gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP)-like peptide in the 
      hindbrain of rat was demonstrated immunohistochemically using antisera directed 
      against the N-terminus and C-terminus of GRP. N-terminal and C-terminal-like 
      immunoreactive material were distributed throughout the nucleus of the solitary 
      tract (NTS), dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) and tractus solitarius (TS), as 
      well as in areas postrema (AP) and substantia gelatinosa separating AP from NTS. 
      Positive immunostaining was localised to a dense network of nerve fibres which 
      project longitudinally along the neuraxis. Immunolabelled cell bodies were observed 
      rostral to the obex, principally in the mediolateral subnucleus of NTS. These 
      immunopositive neurones project their axons caudally and longitudinally towards the 
      commissural subnucleus of the NTS. Immunolabelled cell bodies also were found in AP; 
      they projected their axons caudally and ventrally towards NTS. Positive 
      immunostaining was blocked by pre-adsorbing antisera with either GRP (1 nmol/ml) or 
      bombesin (3 nmol/ml), but was unaffected by substance P (30 nmol/ml) and spared by 
      capsaicin pretreatments which deplete sensory nerves of their peptide content. The 
      results indicate that NTS neurons containing a GRP-like peptide connect the rostral 
      and caudal regions of the dorsal vagal complex by way of longitudinal nerve tracts 
      descending NTS and TS. Some neurons in AP also contain a GRP-like peptide and appear 
      to connect with the dorsal vagal complex.

TI  - Neuroprotective signal transduction in model motor neurons exposed to thrombin: 
      G-protein modulation effects on neurite outgrowth, Ca(2+) mobilization, and 
      apoptosis.
PG  - 87-100
AB  - Thrombin, the ultimate protease in the blood coagulation cascade, mediates its known 
      cellular effects by unique proteolytic activation of G-protein-coupled 
      protease-activated receptors (PARs), such as PAR1, PAR3, and PAR4, and a "tethered 
      ligand" mechanism. PAR1 is variably expressed in subpopulations of neurons and 
      largely determines thrombin's effects on morphology, calcium mobilization, and 
      caspase-mediated apoptosis. In spinal cord motoneurons, PAR1 expression correlates 
      with transient thrombin-mediated [Ca(2+)](i) flux, receptor cleavage, and elevation 
      of rest [Ca(2+)](i) activating intracellular proteases. At nanomolar concentrations, 
      thrombin retracts neurites via PAR1 activation of the monomeric, 21 kDa Ras 
      G-protein RhoA, which is also involved in neuroprotection at lower thrombin 
      concentrations. Such results suggest potential downstream targets for thrombin's 
      injurious effects. Consequently, we employed several G-protein-specific modulators 
      prior to thrombin exposure in an attempt to uncouple both heterotrimeric and 
      monomeric G-proteins from motoneuronal PAR1. Cholera toxin, stimulating Gs, and 
      lovastatin, which blocks isoprenylation of Rho, reduced thrombin-induced calcium 
      mobilization. In contrast, pertussis toxin and mastoparan, inhibiting or stimulating 
      G(o)/G(i), were found to exacerbate thrombin action. Effects on neuronal rounding 
      and apoptosis were also detected, suggesting therapeutic utility may result from 
      interference with downstream components of thrombin signaling pathways in human 
      motor neuron disorders, and possibly other neurodegenerative diseases. Published

TI  - Nitric oxide synthase and the acetylcholine receptor in the prefrontal cortex: 
      metasynaptic organization of the brain.
PG  - 383-404
AB  - Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) 
      immunoreactivity of the cerebral cortex was studied in adult Macaca fascicularis 
      monkeys at light- and electron microscopic levels. NOS was located by means of the 
      polyclonal antibodies developed by Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY, USA), 
      as primary serum, in a dilution of 1:1000, and nAChR was located by means of 
      biotinylated alpha-bungarotoxin (BTX) obtained from Molecular probes (Eugene, 
      Oregon, USA) in a dilution of 1:2000. While endothelial eNOS outlined blood vessels 
      in the brain, brain-derived (neural) bNOS labelled three well-defined cell types in 
      area 46 of the prefrontal cortex, viz. (a) bipolar cells, scattered through layers 
      III to V, equipped with long dendrites which pass over the thickness of the cortex 
      in a right angle to the pial surface, establishing dendritic bundles closely 
      reminiscent of a columnar organization; (b) large multipolar cells, located mainly 
      in layers V and VI, with axons which interconnect dendritic bundles of the bipolar 
      cells and establish synapses with dendritic shafts and spines of the former; and (c) 
      stellate cells, located in lamina II and III, which establish an axonal network in 
      lamina zonalis (lamina I). This arrangement is most characteristic in area 46 of the 
      prefrontal cortex; areas 10 and 12 display similar features. In contrast, the 
      primary visual cortex (area 17), is lacking any sign of columnar organization. 
      Localization of bNOS immunoreactivity is at marked variance to that of 
      NADPH-diaphorase which labels large pyramidal cells in the primate cortex. Binding 
      of alpha-bungarotoxin (BTX) which labels the alpha 7 subunit of nAChR is located in 
      somata, dendrites and axons of interneurons scattered over the entire width of the 
      prefrontal cortex; on the other hand, the monoclonal antibody mAb 35 which labels 
      subunits alpha 1, alpha 3 and alpha 5 in the main immunogenic region of the 
      receptor, visualizes apical dendritic shafts similar to those like bNOS. Strategic 
      localization of bNOS in the primate prefrontal cortex fulfills criteria of producing 
      a freely diffusing retrograde messenger molecule operative in signal transduction 
      routes subserving topography and columnar organization of the cortex, as well as 
      long-term potentiation and long-term depression phenomena underlying mnemonic and 
      gnostic functions. Common occurrence of bNOS and nAChR in identical or similar 
      structures in the prefrontal cortex suggests that interactions between nitrogen 
      oxide and presynaptically released acetylcholine might be involved in the 
      metasynaptic organization of the cerebral cortex, operating in a non-synaptic manner 
      in maintaining optimal performance on cognitive tasks.

TI  - Mastoparan alters subcellular distribution of profilin and remodels F-actin 
      cytoskeleton in cells of maize root apices.
PG  - 912-22
AB  - Indirect immunofluorescence localization of profilin in cells of maize root apices 
      revealed that this abundant protein was present both in the cytoplasm and within 
      nuclei. Nucleo-cytoplasmic partitioning of profilin exhibits tissue-specific and 
      developmental features. Mastoparan-mediated activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins, 
      presumably through triggering a phosphoinositide-signaling pathway based on 
      phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)), induced relocalization of profilin 
      from nuclei into the cytoplasm of root apex cells. In contrast, PIP(2) accumulated 
      within nuclei of mastoparan-treated root cells. Intriguingly, cytoplasmic 
      accumulation of profilin was associated with remodeling of F-actin arrays in root 
      apex cells. Specifically, dense F-actin networks were dismantled and distinct actin 
      patches became associated with the periphery of small vacuoles. On the other hand, 
      disruption of F-actin with the G-actin sequestering agent latrunculin B does not 
      affect the subcellular distribution of profilin or PIP(2). These data suggest that 
      nuclear profilin can mediate a stimulus-response action on the actin cytoskeleton 
      which is somehow linked to a phosphoinositide-signaling cascade.

TI  - Clottability and cross-linking reactivity of fibrin(ogen) following differential 
      release of fibrinopeptides A and B.
PG  - 582-92
AB  - Human fibrinogen was treated at pH 6.0, 7.3 and 9.0 with thrombin, batroxobin 
      (thrombin-like fraction of Bothrops atrox venom) or an extract of the venom from 
      Ancistrodon contortrix contortrix. These three enzymes released the NH2-terminal 
      fibrinopeptides A and B at different rates. Thrombin-free, preactivated factor XIII 
      (factor XIIIa) was added to incubation mixtures to stabilize resulting fibrin(ogen) 
      aggregates. Cross-linking of gamma-chains and the size of covalently linked 
      fibrin-fibrinogen oligomers were studied in an early stage of fibrinopeptide 
      cleavage using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl 
      sulphate. Batroxobin (pH 7.3) and thrombin (pH 6.0) preferentially released 
      fibrinopeptide A, and resulting fibrin aggregates became rapidly insoluble. However, 
      when fibrinopeptide B was removed with the contortrix enzyme, soluble cross-linked 
      oligomers appeared initially. The opaque fibrin clots, produced by thrombin (pH 6.0) 
      or contortrix procoagulant fraction (pH 7.3), were found to be devoid of 
      alpha-polymers even after prolonged incubation with factor XIIIa. Our data suggest 
      that the solubility and opacity of fibrin networks are not primarily related to the 
      type of the cross-link (gamma-gamma versus alpha-alpha interactions).

TI  - Epileptogenic properties of the mast cell degranulating peptide in CA3 hippocampal 
      neurones.
PG  - 91-100
AB  - The epileptogenic properties of the mast cell degranulating peptide (MCD) have been 
      investigated in the CA3 region of the hippocampal slice preparation. Brief (3-5 min) 
      bath application of MCD (0.5-2 microM) to CA3 hippocampal neurones produced an 
      enhancement of the spontaneous synaptic activity and the appearance of spontaneous 
      bursts that persisted for several hours. These bursts were network driven and the 
      underlying paroxysmal depolarizing shift met the criteria for a giant excitatory 
      postsynaptic potential (EPSP), with a reversal potential close to 0 mV. Furthermore 
      following the application of MCD, stimulation of the mossy fibres, commissural or 
      temporo-ammonic pathway evoked an EPSP followed by an evoked network burst. The 
      bursts which could be elicited for several hours were reversibly blocked by a brief 
      application of tetrodotoxin (TTX; 1 microM) or cobalt (2 mM). In contrast, prior and 
      concomitant treatment with TTX or cobalt prevented the occurrence of the bursts 
      induced by MCD. The effects of MCD were not due to a blockade of GABAergic 
      inhibition since the toxin did not reduce the fast and slow IPSP. Furthermore, the 
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists D-2-amino-phosphonovalerate (D-APV; 30 
      microM) or DL-amino-phosphoheptanoic acid (AP-7, 30 microM) did not block the action 
      of MCD, suggesting that the activation of NMDA receptors are neither necessary nor 
      sufficient for MCD-induced bursts. It is concluded that MCD induces in the CA3 
      region long-lasting changes in the synaptic responses which may be mediated through 
      a presynaptic mechanism.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of exenatide monotherapy over 24 weeks in antidiabetic 
      drug-naive patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group study.
PG  - 1448-60
LID - 10.1016/j.clinthera.2008.08.006 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evaluation of exenatide monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes may 
      be of clinical interest based on improvements in glycemic control and weight that 
      have been reported with the use of exenatide in combination with oral antidiabetic 
      agents. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and 
      tolerability of exenatide monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes naive to 
      antidiabetic agents and whose disease was inadequately controlled with diet and 
      exercise alone. METHODS: This 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
      parallel-group study was conducted at 23 centers across the United States, Puerto 
      Rico, Romania, Russia, and India. Patients aged >or=18 years with type 2 diabetes 
      were randomly assigned to receive exenatide 5 microg, exenatide 10 microg, or 
      placebo administered SC BID. Patients were instructed by investigators to maintain 
      their individualized prestudy diet and exercise regimens throughout the study. 
      Efficacy measures included: glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)); fasting serum glucose 
      (FSG); 6-point self-monitored blood glucose; percentages of patients achieving 
      HbA(1c) values <or=6.5% and <or=7.0%; weight; and homeostasis model of beta-cell 
      function (HOMA-B, a clinical measure of pancreatic beta-cell function). Tolerability 
      measures included patient-reported adverse events, hypoglycemia, and blood pressure. 
      RESULTS: A total of 232 patients were included in the intent-to-treat population 
      (130 men, 102 women; 68% white; mean [SD] age, 54 [10] years; duration of type 2 
      diabetes, 2 [3] years; weight, 86 [16] kg; body mass index, 31 [5] kg/m(2); HbA(1c), 
      7.8% [0.9%]). At end point, least-squares mean (SE) HbA(1c) reductions (%) from 
      baseline were significantly greater with exenatide 5 and 10 microg than placebo 
      (-0.7 [0.1] and -0.9 [0.1] vs -0.2 [0.1]; P = 0.003 and P < 0.001, respectively), as 
      were FSG reductions (mg/dL) (-17.5 [4.0] and -18.7 [4.0] vs -5.2 [4.0]; P = 0.029 
      and P = 0.016, respectively). Changes in daily mean postprandial glucose excursions 
      (mg/dL) from baseline to end point were significantly greater with exenatide 5 and 
      10 microg than placebo (-21.3 [2.7] and -24.7 [2.7] vs -8.3 [2.5]; both, P < 0.001). 
      With exenatide 5 and 10 microg, 31% and 35% of patients achieved HbA(1c) <or=6.5% at 
      end point versus 19% with placebo (P = NS and P = 0.026, respectively), while 48% 
      and 46% versus 29% achieved HbA(1c) <or=7.0% (P = 0.024 and P = 0.036, 
      respectively). Changes in weight (kg) at 24 weeks were greater with exenatide 5 and 
      10 (2)g than placebo (-2.8 [0.3] and -3.1 [0.3] vs -1.4 [0.3]; P = 0.004 and P < 
      0.001, respectively). HOMA-B values increased from baseline to end point by 32% and 
      28% in the exenatide 5- and 10-microg groups, respectively, versus 6% for placebo. 
      Improvements from baseline to end point in HOMA-B were significantly greater with 
      exenatide 5 and 10 microg than placebo (P = 0.002 and P = 0.010, respectively). 
      Significant improvements in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) from 
      baseline to end point were also observed with exenatide (systolic, both 5 and 10 
      microg, -3.7 [1.2] [P = 0.037]; diastolic, 10 microg, -2.3 [0.7] [P = 0.046]) versus 
      placebo (systolic, -0.3 [1.2]; diastolic, -0.3 [0.7]). Overall, 25% of patients 
      reported >or=1 treatment-emergent adverse event. Nausea was reported with the 
      greatest incidence (5 microg, 3%; 10 microg, 13%; placebo, 0%; P = 0.010 for the 
      combined exenatide group vs placebo). Most (88%) treatment-emergent adverse events 
      were mild or moderate in intensity. Hypoglycemia was reported in 5%, 4%, and 1% of 
      patients in the exenatide 5- and 10-microg and placebo groups, respectively (P = 
      NS), with no incidents of severe hypoglycemia reported. CONCLUSIONS: In these 
      patients with type 2 diabetes naive to treatment with antidiabetic agents, exenatide 
      monotherapy was associated with improved HbA(1c), improved fasting and postprandial 
      glucose control, reduced weight, improved beta-cell function (HOMA-B), and improved 
      blood pressure, and was well tolerated. These results suggest that exenatide 
      monotherapy may provide a viable treatment option beyond diet and exercise and 
      support further study of exenatide monotherapy in antidiabetic drug-naive patients 
      with type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Release of bombesin-like immunoreactivity from synaptosomal membranes isolated from 
      the rat ileum.
PG  - 169-79
AB  - In the enteric nervous system, direct effects on peptidergic neurotransmitter 
      release are difficult to assess since the neuronal network predisposes to numerous 
      interactions between the various transmitter systems. The aim of the present study 
      was to examine the release of bombesin-like immunoreactivity from isolated nerve 
      synapses of the enteric nervous system. Enriched synaptosomal fractions were 
      obtained by using homogenized tissue from rat ileum, which was subjected to various 
      steps of differential and sucrose density centrifugation. Specific binding of 
      [3H]saxitoxin served as a marker for neuronal membranes. For comparison, the content 
      of bombesin-like immunoreactivity was determined. Both the enriched synaptosomal 
      fraction (mitochondrial fraction II or P2) and the purified synaptosomal fraction 
      (F2), obtained after discontinuous sucrose density centrifugation, showed 
      substantial enrichment of the neuronal marker [3H]saxitoxin and bombesin-like 
      immunoreactivity. The basal release of bombesin-like immunoreactivity was 52 +/- 17 
      pg/mg (100%). KCl-evoked depolarization (65 mM) significantly stimulated the release 
      of bombesin-like immunoreactivity to 142.2% (P < 0.05, n = 17). The release was 
      abolished in Ca(2+)-free medium. Stimulation of the release of bombesin-like 
      immunoreactivity was also observed in the presence of the Ca2+ ionophore A-23187 
      (10(-6) M: 129%, P < 0.05, n = 17), supporting the role of Ca2+ in the release 
      process. Cholinergic stimulation with carbachol elicited a significant 
      dose-dependent release of bombesin-like immunoreactivity (10(-8) M: 106%, 10(-7) M: 
      175%, P < 0.05, 10(-6) M: 156%, P < 0.05, 10(-5) M: 115%, n = 14), which was reduced 
      by atropine (10(-6) M: 99%, P < 0.01, n = 14). The basal value was 67 +/- 9 pg/mg 
      (100%). The different effects of the muscarinic M1 receptor antagonist pirenzepine, 
      which stimulated release of bombesin-like immunoreactivity in combination with 
      carbachol 10(-6) M (10(-6) M: 123%, n = 10), and of the muscarinic M2 receptor 
      antagonist AFDX 116, which attenuated release of bombesin-like immunoreactivity 
      evoked by carbachol (10(-5) M: 66%, P < 0.01, 10(-6) M: 88%, n = 10), strongly 
      suggest modulation of the release of bombesin-like immunoreactivity at the 
      presynaptic receptor site through an excitatory muscarinic M2 receptor. The basal 
      value was 46 +/- 9 pg/mg (100%). In summary, bombesin-like immunoreactivity can be 
      released from these synaptosomes by both depolarization with KCl in a 
      Ca(2+)-dependent manner and by cholinergic stimulation. The synaptosomes of 
      intrinsic nerves of the gut offer an approach to study the release of neuropeptides 
      and neurotransmitters at the subcellular level independent of the ganglionic 
      network.

TI  - Bombesin-like immunoreactivity and the effect of bombesin in the gut, circulatory 
      system and lung of the caiman, Caiman crocodylus crocodylus, and the crocodile, 
      Crocodylus porosus.
PG  - 261-71
AB  - The presence of bombesin-like material in nerves and endocrine cells of the 
      gastrointestinal canal, the circulatory system and the lung of the caiman, Caiman 
      crocodylus crocodylus, has been investigated with immunohistochemistry (IHC) and 
      radioimmunoassay (RIA). The effect of bombesin has been studied on the vascularly 
      perfused lung and on isolated strip preparations of the gut wall of the caiman, and 
      on the circulatory system in vivo in both the caiman and the crocodile, Crocodylus 
      porosus. Bombesin-like immunoreactivity is present in water and acid extracts of the 
      muscle layer and the mucosal layer of the gut. IHC demonstrated a dense network of 
      nerve fibres in the sub-mucosa, circular muscle layer and myenteric plexus of the 
      whole gut. A more sparse innervation by single fibres often following septal edges 
      or small vessels is found in the lung. Systemic vessels are innervated by a loose 
      plexus of small fibre bundles. The levels of immunoreactive material in the lung and 
      heart were low. Bombesin is excitatory on strip preparations of the smooth muscle 
      layers of the intestinal wall, and causes an increase in inflow resistance in the 
      perfused lung. In vivo, bombesin increases the blood flow in the left aorta and the 
      coeliac artery.

TI  - Polarized sorting of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors to the postsynaptic membrane 
      in Torpedo electrocyte.
PG  - 839-52
AB  - Several regulatory mechanisms contribute to the accumulation and maintenance of high 
      concentrations of acetylcholine receptors (AChR) at the postsynaptic membrane of the 
      neuromuscular junction, including compartmentalized gene transcription, targeting, 
      clustering and anchoring to the cytoskeleton. The targeting of the AChR to the 
      postsynaptic membrane is likely to involve a polarized sorting in the exocytic 
      pathway. In this work, we used the electrocyte of Torpedo marmorata electric organ 
      to study the intracellular trafficking of neosynthesized AChR and its delivery to 
      the postsynaptic membrane. Gradient centrifugation and immunoisolation techniques 
      have led to the isolation of two populations of post-Golgi transport vesicles (PGVs) 
      enriched in proteins of either the innervated (AChR) or non-innervated (Na,K-ATPase) 
      membrane domains of the cell. Immunolabelling of these vesicles at the EM level 
      disclosed that very few PGVs contained both proteins. In AChR-enriched vesicles, 
      high sialylation of AchR molecules, an expected post-translational modification of 
      proteins exiting the trans-Golgi network, and the presence of a marker of the 
      exocytic pathway (Rab6p), indicate that these vesicles are carriers engaged in the 
      Golgi-to-plasma membrane transport. These data suggest that AChR and Na,K-ATPase are 
      sorted intracellularly most likely within the trans-Golgi network. Furthermore, EM 
      analysis and immunogold-labelling experiments provided in situ evidence that the 
      AChR-containing PGVs are conveyed to the postsynaptic membrane, possibly by a 
      microtubule-dependent transport mechanism. Our data therefore provide the first 
      evidence that the targeting of receptors for neurotransmitters to synaptic sites 
      could be contributed by intracellular sorting and polarized delivery in the exocytic 
      pathway.

TI  - Single sodium channels from human skeletal muscle in planar lipid bilayers: 
      characterization and response to pentobarbital.
PG  - 100-6
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the response to general anesthetics of different 
      sodium-channel subtypes, we examined the effects of pentobarbital, a close 
      thiopental analogue, on single sodium channels from human skeletal muscle and 
      compared them to existing data from human brain and human ventricular muscle 
      channels. METHODS: Sodium channels from a preparation of human skeletal muscle were 
      incorporated into planar lipid bilayers, and the steady-state behavior of single 
      sodium channels and their response to pentobarbital was examined in the presence of 
      batrachotoxin, a sodium-channel activator. Single-channel currents were recorded 
      before and after the addition of pentobarbital (0.34-1.34 mM). RESULTS: In 
      symmetrical 500 mM NaCl, human skeletal muscle sodium channels had an averaged 
      single-channel conductance of 21.0 +/- 0.6 pS, and the channel fractional open time 
      was 0.96 +/- 0.04. The activation midpoint potential was -96.2 +/- 1.6 mV. 
      Extracellular tetrodotoxin blocked the channel with a half-maximal concentration 
      (k1/2) of 60 nM at 0 mV. Pentobarbital reduced the time-averaged conductance of 
      single skeletal muscle sodium channels in a concentration-dependent manner 
      (inhibitory concentration 50% [IC50] = 0.66 mM). The steady-state activation was 
      shifted to more hyperpolarized potentials (-16.7 mV at 0.67 mM pentobarbital). 
      CONCLUSION: In the planar lipid bilayer system, skeletal muscle sodium channels have 
      some electrophysiological properties that are significantly different compared with 
      those of sodium channels from cardiac or from central nervous tissue. In contrast to 
      the control data, these different human sodium channel subtypes showed the same 
      qualitative and quantitative response to the general anesthetic pentobarbital. The 
      implication of these effects for overall anesthesia will depend on the role the 
      individual channels play within their neuronal networks, but suppression of both 
      central nervous system and peripheral sodium channels may add to general anesthetic 
      effects.

TI  - Hepatocyte growth factor-stimulating endothelial cell growth and accelerating 
      glomerular capillary repair in experimental progressive glomerulonephritis.
PG  - e44-54
AB  - Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is one of the major growth factors that stimulate the 
      growth and the migration of vascular endothelial cells. In this study, we examined 
      the beneficial effects of HGF for glomerular repair in an experimental progressive 
      glomerulonephritis (GN) model prepared by injecting both anti-Thy-1.1 antibody (day 
      0) and habu-snake venom (day 1) in rats. The rats received continuous 
      intraperitoneal administration of recombinant human HGF (80 microg/100 g/day) or 
      vehicle control at an early stage (day 2 to day 9), after severe glomerular injury. 
      The vehicle-infused control rats initially showed severe mesangiolysis with large 
      ballooning (day 2), followed by the prominent proliferation of mesangial cells with 
      minimal capillary regeneration (day 5 to week 2), and global sclerosis with chronic 
      renal failure (week 4 to week 8). Although mesangiolysis with large ballooning and 
      mesangial cell proliferation were also observed in the HGF-infused rats, glomerular 
      capillary regeneration with marked endothelial cell proliferation occurred during 
      HGF administration from day 2 to day 9. Subsequently, the glomerulus was repaired 
      with the development of the capillary network and the reduction of mesangial 
      hypercellularity from week 2 to week 4, and almost all of the glomeruli showed a 
      normal structure by week 8. The HGF-treated rats showed significantly better renal 
      functions (Cr: 0.3 +/- 0.1 vs. 3.5 +/- 1.1 mg/dl in control, p < 0.001), less 
      proteinuria (21.2 +/- 8.0 mg/day vs. 421.4 +/- 45.1 mg/day in control, p < 0.001) 
      and less glomerular sclerosis at week 8 than the vehicle-infused rats. We conclude 
      that HGF accelerated glomerular repair through the growth of capillary endothelial 
      cells and capillary regeneration in experimental progressive GN. Administering HGF 
      is a logical and efficient strategy for treating progressive GN with severe 
      capillary destruction.

TI  - Cooperative effects of bombesin, substance P and methacholine on the release of 
      intestinal neurotensin in rats.
PG  - 123-34
AB  - The secretion of ileal neurotensin (NT) results from events occurring at the apical 
      and basal side of the N-cells. The hypothesis of a functional relationship between 
      cholinergic and peptidergic neurones with the N-cell was investigated in the present 
      study utilizing the isolated vascularly perfused rat ileum. Intraarterial 
      methacholine (MC, 10(-4) M) evoked a prompt and well sustained release of NT in the 
      portal effluent (plateau value at 500% of basal). This effect was dose-dependent 
      over the range of 10(-6) M to 10(-4) M. Bombesin (B) provoked a dose-dependent peak 
      secretion of NT (800% of basal at 10(-7) M) followed by a rapid return to almost 
      basal levels. The B-induced NT release remained unaltered upon 10(-6) M tetrodotoxin 
      (TTX) or 10(-5) M atropine infusion. Substance P (SP) potently stimulated the 
      release of NT. The maximal response, consisting of a sustained secretion, was 
      observed at a concentration of 10(-7) M (350% of basal) while 10(-6) M SP induced a 
      transient release. TTX or atropine did not reduce significantly the SP-induced 
      secretion of NT. Neurokinin A and B did not increase NT concentrations in the portal 
      effluent. B synergistically increased the secretion of NT induced by SP. Atropine or 
      TTX did not modify the effect of combined SP and B infusion. MC potentiated the 
      release of NT induced by B but not that evoked by SP. Combined infusion of SP, B and 
      MC produced the largest output of NT. In conclusion, B, SP and MC are strong 
      stimulants of NT release in rats. In addition, the cooperative effects of these 
      transmitters argue in favor of a complex functional relationship between the 
      intramural nervous network and the intestinal N-cells in rats.

TI  - Species-specific effects of bombesin on gastric emptying and neurohypophyseal 
      secretion.
PG  - 1289-93
AB  - Previous reports have demonstrated that systemic injection of cholecystokinin (CCK) 
      in rats produces dose-related decreases in food intake, increases in 
      neurohypophyseal secretion of oxytocin (OT), and decreases in gastric emptying. The 
      present studies determined whether systemic injection of bombesin (BBS), another 
      peptide that potently reduces food intake in rats, had similar effects on OT 
      secretion and gastric emptying. Although BBS produces a dose-dependent inhibition of 
      food intake, even very high doses did not significantly affect plasma OT levels and 
      only slightly decreased rates of gastric emptying. Consequently, despite their 
      similar inhibitory effects on food intake, BBS does not appear to activate the same 
      network of central nervous system pathways as does CCK in rats. However, parallel 
      studies in monkeys demonstrated that systemic injection of BBS was effective in 
      stimulating neurohypophyseal secretion of vasopressin rather than OT, in a pattern 
      both qualitatively and quantitatively analogous to the effects of CCK in this 
      species. Together with previous findings that BBS more potently inhibits gastric 
      emptying in primates than in rats, these results therefore also suggest the presence 
      of significant species differences in the central mechanisms by which BBS acts to 
      reduce food intake.

TI  - Capsaicin-induced depletion of substance P-like immunoreactivity in guinea pig 
      sympathetic ganglia.
PG  - 595-606
AB  - The distribution of substance P immunoreactive nerve fibers in guinea pig 
      sympathetic ganglia was studied in normal and capsaicin-treated animals. A marked 
      depletion of substance P-like immunoreactivity was observed in both pre- and 
      paravertebral ganglia after capsaicin treatment. In the inferior mesenteric and 
      pelvic ganglia, however, intensely fluorescent fibers surrounding some of the 
      principal ganglion cells remain after capsaicin treatment. Ligation experiments on 
      the inferior mesenteric ganglion indicate that the capsaicin-insensitive substance P 
      immunoreactive fibers in this ganglion are of lumbar splanchnic origin. Whether or 
      not they represent capsaicin-resistant primary afferent neurons is not known. The 
      enkephalin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, cholecystokinin and bombesin 
      immunoreactive fiber networks in the inferior mesenteric ganglion were also studied, 
      and no differences were observed between normal and capsaicin-treated animals.

TI  - Bombesin, vasopressin, and endothelin rapidly stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of 
      the focal adhesion-associated protein paxillin in Swiss 3T3 cells.
PG  - 22060-5
AB  - Treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with bombesin caused a striking increase (21-fold) in 
      the tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoskeleton-associated protein paxillin, as 
      judged by anti-phosphotyrosine Western blots of anti-paxillin immunoprecipitates. 
      Vasopressin and endothelin also stimulated paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation. 
      Bombesin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin was detectable within 1 min 
      and was concentration-dependent (half-maximum effect at 0.09 nM). Bombesin 
      stimulation of paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation could be dissociated from both 
      protein kinase C (PKC) activation and the mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular 
      stores. Activation of PKC in quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells using the tumor promoter 
      phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDB) increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin in 
      a time-dependent manner but was less effective than bombesin and stimulated 
      detectable phosphorylation only within 5 min, considerably slower than 
      bombesin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin. Furthermore, the selective 
      PKC inhibitor, GF109203X, or down-regulation of PKC using prolonged treatment with 
      PDB markedly inhibited the stimulation of paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation by PDB 
      but had little effect on the response to bombesin. In contrast, cytochalasin D, an 
      agent that selectively disrupts the network of actin microfilaments, completely 
      inhibited bombesin- and PDB-induced paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation. This is the 
      first report to identify paxillin as a substrate for neuropeptide-stimulated 
      tyrosine phosphorylation.

TI  - Three-dimensional structure of echistatin, the smallest active RGD protein.
PG  - 7369-72
AB  - Echistatin is a 49 amino acid protein isolated from the venom of a viper (Echis 
      carinatus) and is one of the smallest natural adhesive ligands that interacts with 
      integrin-type receptors through an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence. The structure of 
      echistatin in aqueous solution has been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance 
      spectroscopy. Nuclear Overhauser spectra yielded 490 interatomic distance 
      constraints, which were used in distance geometry calculations. The chain is shown 
      to fold in a series of irregular loops to form a rigid core stabilized by four 
      cystine cross-links. From this core an irregular hairpin and the C-terminus 
      protrude. The core and the hairpin are further stabilized by a network of hydrogen 
      bonds. The RGD sequence is located in a mobile loop at the tip of the hairpin. The 
      mobility and its significance for activity are discussed.

TI  - An immunohistochemical study on neurons and paraneurons of the pre- and post-natal 
      chicken lung.
PG  - 125-35
AB  - The indirect immunoperoxidase (PAP) method was used on chicken lung specimens from 
      embryos ranging in age from 6 days to hatching, chicks and adult chickens of up to 6 
      months. The ontogenesis and distribution of neurons and paraneurons containing 
      immunoreactivities for serotonin (5HT), bombesin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide 
      (VIP), substance P (SP) and galanin were investigated. Serotonin-immunoreactive 
      paraneurons were first detected in the pulmonary mesenchyma of 8-day-old embryos, 
      while in the 12-day-old embryos the following neurons and paraneurons were first 
      detected in their respective locations: serotonin-immunoreactive paraneurons in the 
      bronchial epithelium; VIP- and galanin-immunoreactive ganglionic cells and 
      SP-immunoreactive nerve fibres in the intrapulmonary ganglia. At hatching, 
      serotonin-immunoreactive paraneurons in the epithelium of the air capillaries and 
      air sacs, and bombesin-immunoreactive paraneurons in the epithelium of the primary 
      bronchus, VIP-, galanin- and SP-immunoreactive nerve fibres in the lamina propria of 
      the primary and secondary bronchi and in the pulmonary septa could also be shown. 
      Some serotonin-immunoreactive small paraneurons were also found in the 
      intrapulmonary ganglia. In the adult specimens, VIP-, galanin- and SP-immunoreactive 
      nerve fibre networks were observed throughout the primary bronchus wall and in the 
      lung septa. In intrapulmonary ganglia, VIP- and galanin-immunoreactive neurons and 
      serotonin-immunoreactive small paraneurons could be more numerously demonstrated. 
      Moreover, bombesin paraneurons occurred in the epithelium of primary and secondary 
      bronchi, and serotonin-immunoreactive paraneurons were found in the epithelia of the 
      bronchi and air sacs and in some pluricellular bodies in the lamina propria of the 
      air sac ostia.

TI  - Haemostatic clot formation at anastomosis of synthetic venous graft in 
      defibrinogenated dogs: a scanning electron microscopic study.
PG  - 276-81
AB  - A segment of the inferior vena cava was replaced by an expanded 
      polytetrafluoroethylene graft in 13 dogs. Five of them served as a control group, 
      while the other 8 were moderately or severely defibrinogenated with subcutaneous 
      batroxobin. Plasma fibrinogen decreased to extremely low values throughout the 
      experiment in the defibrinogenated dogs except in the moderately treated group in 
      which it temporarily rose to 0.72-0.87 g/l on the first postoperative day. Scanning 
      electron microscopic observations of the haemostatic clot formed at the anastomoses 
      of the graft revealed no significant morphological differences in platelet adhesion 
      and/or aggregation between the three groups. These findings confirmed that platelets 
      play a key role in primary haemostasis during defibrinogenation. The fibrin network 
      was slightly diminished and only short fibrin filaments could be seen in the 
      moderately and severely defibrinogenated groups respectively. These differences in 
      composition of the clots are discussed in relation to their haemostatic capacity.

TI  - A secondary structure prediction of the hemorrhagic metalloprotease family.
PG  - 560-5
AB  - A secondary structure has been predicted for the hemorrhagic metalloproteases using 
      a method developed in Zurich that extracts structural information from patterns of 
      conservation and variation in homologous protein sequences. This prediction tests 
      the limits of the method when applied to a small number of homologous sequences that 
      have undergone only modest evolutionary divergence. Predictions were also obtained 
      using a neural network developed by Sander and coworkers, to date the best fully 
      automated method for predicting secondary structure, and using the classical 
      Chou-Fasman and GOR heuristics. The predictions are different. No crystal structure 
      is known within this protein family, but one is expected shortly. Therefore, this 
      prediction should contribute significantly to the evaluation of the relative merits 
      of these prediction methods.

TI  - In vitro effect of bombesin-related peptides on the procoagulant activity of 
      alveolar macrophages.
PG  - 187-90
AB  - Bombesin-related peptides (BRP) are present in the lung during foetal life and are 
      mitogenic for normal bronchial epithelial cells, pulmonary fibroblasts, and 
      small-cell lung carcinoma cell lines. Increased levels of BRP have been described in 
      the adult lung of cigarette smokers and in smoking related lung diseases. BRP have 
      also been involved in the network of neuroimmune interactions, having been shown to 
      modulate the phagocytic function of monocytes and alveolar macrophages. BRP have 
      recently been shown to modulate the release of procoagulant activity (PCA) by human 
      monocytes and alveolar macrophages after a 24 h culture. The aim of this study was 
      to evaluate the effect of bombesin on cell-associated PCA of alveolar macrophages 
      (AMs) obtained from asymptomatic subjects. In basal conditions, AMs were found to 
      possess a low procoagulant activity, that was not affected by their preincubation (4 
      h at 37 degrees C) with phorbol myristate acetate (1 microgram-mL-1). On the 
      contrary, endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) induced a significant increase of 
      procoagulant activity of macrophages when used at a concentration of 1 
      microgram.mL-1, in the same experimental conditions; whilst a lower (1 ng.mL-1) 
      concentration of LPS nonsignificantly enhanced cell-associated PCA. Treatment of AMs 
      with synthetic bombesin (BN) alone (10(-6) to 10(-10) M) did not enhance 
      cell-associated PCA, whilst a significant effect was seen when BN was added to the 
      lower concentration of LPS (BN 10(-6) M+LPS 1 ng.mL-1: 12.6 U.10(-6) cells; LPS 
      alone 1 ng.mL-1: 7.8 U.10(-6) cells).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Regulation and recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase on immature secretory 
      granules is independent of ADP-ribosylation factor 1.
PG  - 289-95
AB  - Heterotrimeric G-proteins, as well as small GTPases of the Rho and ADP-ribosylation 
      factor (ARF) family, are implicated in the regulation of lipid kinases, including 
      PtdIns 4-kinases and PtdIns(4)P 5-kinases. Here, we describe a PtdIns 4-kinase 
      activity on immature secretory granules (ISGs), regulated secretory organelles 
      formed from the trans-Golgi network (TGN), and investigate the regulation of 
      PtdIns4P levels on these membranes. Over 50% of the PtdIns 4-kinase activity on ISGs 
      is inhibited by both a low concentration of adenosine and the monoclonal antibody 
      4C5G, a specific inhibitor of the type II PtdIns 4-kinase. Treatment of ISGs with 
      mastoparan 7 (M7) stimulates the type II PtdIns 4-kinase via 
      pertussis-toxin-sensitive G(i)/G(0) proteins, which, in contrast with previous 
      results obtained with chromaffin granules [Gasman, Chasserot-Golaz, Hubert, Aunis 
      and Bader (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 16913-16920], does not require Rho A, B or C. 
      M7 treatment also leads to an inhibition in the recruitment of ARF to ISG membranes: 
      this inhibition is not dependent on G(i)/G(0) activation, and is not linked to the 
      stimulation of PtdIns 4-kinase observed with M7. PtdIns 4-kinase activity on ISGs is 
      not regulated by myristoylated ARF1-GTP, in contrast with results obtained with 
      Golgi membranes [Godi, Pertile, Meyers, Marra, Di Tullio, Iurisci, Luini, Corda and 
      De Matteis (1999) Nat. Cell Biol. 1, 280-287; Jones, Morris, Morgan, Kondo, Irvine 
      and Cockcroft (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 13962-13170], whereas ARF1-GTP does 
      regulate the production of PtdIns(4,5)P(2). Our results suggest that the regulation 
      of PtdIns 4-kinase on the ISGs differs in comparison with that on the TGN, and might 
      be related to a specific requirement of ISG maturation.

TI  - Involvement of endogenous tachykinins and CGRP in the motor responses produced by 
      capsaicin in the guinea-pig common bile duct.
PG  - 344-53
AB  - In functional experiments, we have investigated the effect exerted by 
      neurotransmitters released from capsaicin-sensitive primary afferent nerve terminals 
      in the isolated guinea-pig common bile duct. In resting preparations, capsaicin (0.1 
      microM) produced a quick contraction (45.1+/-4% of KCl 80mM) which was abolished by 
      either atropine (1 microM) or tetrodotoxin (0.5 microM). The tachykinin 
      receptor-selective antagonists GR 82334 (NK1 receptor-selective; 3 microM), MEN 
      11420 (NK2 receptor-selective; 1 microM) and SR 142801 (NK3 receptor-selective; 0.1 
      microM) administered separately failed to reduce the capsaicin-evoked contraction, 
      whereas any combination of the three antagonists was effective: GR 82334 plus MEN 
      11420, 36+/-7% reduction; GR 82334 plus SR 142801, 48+/-4% reduction; MEN 11420 plus 
      SR 142801, 55+/-3% reduction; GR 82334 plus MEN 11420 plus SR 142801, 57+/-5% 
      reduction. Neither the CGRP1 receptor antagonist h-CGRP (8-37) (1.5 microM) nor the 
      P2X purinoceptor antagonist PPADS (50 microM) affected the contractile response to 
      capsaicin. The effect of capsaicin (0.1 microM) was abolished by pretreatment with 
      capsaicin itself (10 microM for 15 min). Human calcitonin gene-related peptide 
      (h-CGRP; 0.1 microM) mimicked the effect of capsaicin on resting preparations 
      (contractile response =28% of KCl 80 mM). In preparations precontracted with a 
      submaximal concentration of KCl (24 mM), and in the presence of atropine (1 microM), 
      GR 82334 (3 microM) and MEN 11420 (3 microM), capsaicin (1 microM) produced a 
      tetrodotoxin-insensitive long-lasting relaxation (45+/-3% reduction of tone, at 4min 
      from administration), which was unaffected by the nitric oxide (NO) synthase 
      inhibitor, L-NOARG (100 microM). h-CGRP (10-50 nM) produced a similar sustained 
      relaxation of precontracted preparations (59+/-4% reduction of tone). h-CGRP (8-37) 
      (1.5 microM) almost completely reversed the relaxations produced by both capsaicin 
      and h-CGRP. Application of electrical field stimulation (EFS: trains of stimuli of 
      10Hz; 0.25ms pulse width; supramaximal voltage; for 60s) to precontracted 
      preparations produced a sustained, tetrodotoxin (1 microM)-sensitive relaxation 
      (32+/-4% reduction of tone). L-NOARG (100 microM) greatly reduced (69+/-5% 
      inhibition) the EFS-elicited relaxation. A complete reversal of the relaxant 
      response to EFS into a contraction was obtained by administering L-NOARG to 
      preparations in which a functional blockade of capsaicin-sensitive primary afferent 
      neurons had been achieved by incubating the tissue with capsaicin (10 microM) for 15 
      min. At immunohistochemistry, tachykinin- and CGRP-immunoreactivities 
      (TK-IR/CGRP-IR) were detected in varicose nerve fibers throughout the common bile 
      duct, while TK-IR cell bodies were observed in the terminal portion (ampulla) only. 
      In vivo pretreatment with capsaicin (50 mg/kg; 6-7 days before) decreased the number 
      of CGRP-IR nerves, whereas the TK-IR neural network was apparently unchanged. In 
      conclusion, our data provide functional evidence for the presence of 
      capsaicin-sensitive primary afferent nerve endings in the guinea-pig terminal 
      biliary tract, whose stimulation by capsaicin or EFS produces the release of 
      tachykinins and CGRP. In addition, morphological evidence is provided that the bulk 
      of TK-IR material in the biliary tract is contained in intrinsic neuronal elements, 
      while CGRP in this tissue is of extrinsic origin only. Tachykinins, probably 
      released in small amounts by capsaicin, act by activating receptors of the NK1, NK2 
      and NK3 type, most probably located on intrinsic cholinergic neurons, which in turn 
      release ACh to produce the final excitatory motor response. The contractile response 
      to capsaicin obtained in the presence of the three tachykinin receptor antagonists 
      could be due to the co-released CGRP and/or to other unknown neurotransmitters. CGRP 
      produces either indirect excitatory or direct inhibitory responses by stimulation of 
      CGRP2 and CGRP1 receptors, respectively.

AB  - Automated snake image identification is important from different points of view, 
      most importantly, snake bite management. Auto-identification of snake images might 
      help the avoidance of venomous snakes and also providing better treatment for 
      patients. In this study, for the first time, it's been attempted to compare the 
      accuracy of a series of state-of-the-art machine learning methods, ranging from the 
      holistic to neural network algorithms. The study is performed on six snake species 
      in Lar National Park, Tehran Province, Iran. In this research, the holistic methods 
      [k-nearest neighbors (kNN), support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression 
      (LR)] are used in combination with a dimension reduction approach [principle 
      component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA)] as the feature 
      extractor. In holistic methods (kNN, SVM, LR), the classifier in combination with 
      PCA does not yield an accuracy of more than 50%, But the use of LDA to extract the 
      important features significantly improves the performance of the classifier. A 
      combination of LDA and SVM (kernel = 'rbf') is achieved to a test accuracy of 84%. 
      Compared to holistic methods, convolutional neural networks show similar to better 
      performance, and accuracy reaches 93.16% using MobileNetV2. Visualizing intermediate 
      activation layers in VGG model reveals that just in deep activation layers, the 
      color pattern and the shape of the snake contribute to the discrimination of snake 
      species. This study presents MobileNetV2 as a powerful deep convolutional neural 
      network algorithm for snake image classification that could be used even on mobile 
      devices. This finding pave the road for generating mobile applications for snake 
      image identification.

AB  - Fish ecosystems perform ecological functions that are critically important for the 
      sustainability of marine ecosystems, such as global food security and carbon stock. 
      During the 21st century, significant global warming caused by climate change has 
      created pressing challenges for fish ecosystems that threaten species existence and 
      global ecosystem health. Here, we study a coastal fish community in Maizuru Bay, 
      Japan, and investigate the relationships between fluctuations of ST, abundance-based 
      species interactions and salient fish biodiversity. Observations show that a local 
      20% increase in temperature from 2002 to 2014 underpins a long-term reduction in 
      fish diversity (∼25%) played out by some native and invasive species (e.g. Chinese 
      wrasse) becoming exceedingly abundant; this causes a large decay in commercially 
      valuable species (e.g. Japanese anchovy) coupled to an increase in ecological 
      productivity. The fish community is analyzed considering five temperature ranges to 
      understand its atemporal seasonal sensitivity to ST changes, and long-term trends. 
      An optimal information flow model is used to reconstruct species interaction 
      networks that emerge as topologically different for distinct temperature ranges and 
      species dynamics. Networks for low temperatures are more scale-free compared to ones 
      for intermediate (15-20°C) temperatures in which the fish ecosystem experiences a 
      first-order phase transition in interactions from locally stable to metastable and 
      globally unstable for high temperatures states as suggested by abundance-spectrum 
      transitions. The dynamic dominant eigenvalue of species interactions shows 
      increasing instability for competitive species (spiking in summer due to 
      intermediate-season critical transitions) leading to enhanced community variability 
      and critical slowing down despite higher time-point resilience. Native competitive 
      species whose abundance is distributed more exponentially have the highest total 
      directed interactions and are keystone species (e.g. Wrasse and Horse mackerel) for 
      the most salient links with cooperative decaying species. Competitive species, with 
      higher eco-climatic memory and synchronization, are the most affected by temperature 
      and play an important role in maintaining fish ecosystem stability via multitrophic 
      cascades (via cooperative-competitive species imbalance), and as bioindicators of 
      change. More climate-fitted species follow temperature increase causing larger 
      divergence divergence between competitive and cooperative species. Decreasing 
      dominant eigenvalues and lower relative network optimality for warmer oceans 
      indicate fishery more attracted toward persistent oscillatory states, yet 
      unpredictable, with lower cooperation, diversity and fish stock despite the increase 
      in community abundance due to non-commercial and venomous species. We emphasize how 
      changes in species interaction organization, primarily affected by temperature 
      fluctuations, are the backbone of biodiversity dynamics and yet for functional 
      diversity in contrast to taxonomic richness. Abundance and richness manifest gradual 
      shifts while interactions show sudden shift. The work provides data-driven tools for 
      analyzing and monitoring fish ecosystems under the pressure of global warming or 
      other stressors. Abundance and interaction patterns derived by network-based 
      analyses proved useful to assess ecosystem susceptibility and effective change, and 
      formulate predictive dynamic information for science-based fishery policy aimed to 
      maintain marine ecosystems stable and sustainable.

      Influenced by Melatonin in an in Vivo Model of Ovarian Carcinoma.
PG  - 3872-3882
AB  - To obtain more information into the molecular mechanisms underlying ovarian cancer 
      (OC), we proposed a comparative proteomic analysis in animals receiving long-term 
      melatonin as therapy or only vehicle using multidimensional protein identification 
      combined with mass spectrometry. To induce tumor, a single dose of 100 μg 
      7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) dissolved in 10 μL of sesame oil was injected 
      under the left ovarian bursa of 20 Fischer 344 rats. The right ovaries were injected 
      with sesame oil only. After tumors were developed, half of the animals received 
      intraperitoneal administration of melatonin (200 μg/100g body weight/day) for 60 
      days. Melatonin therapy promoted down-regulation in numerous proteins involved in OC 
      signaling pathways. The most significant portion of these proteins are involved in 
      several metabolic processes, mainly those associated with mitochondrial systems, 
      generation of metabolites and energy, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 signaling, antigen 
      processing and presentation, endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated pathways, and 
      cancer-related proteoglycans. A small number of proteins that were overexpressed by 
      melatonin therapy included ATP synthase subunit β, fatty acid-binding protein, and 
      10-kDa heat shock protein. Taken together, our findings suggest that melatonin 
      therapy efficiently modulated important signaling pathways involved in OC, and these 
      proteins might be further targets that should be explored in new therapeutic 
      opportunities for OC.

TI  - Looking for Mimicry in a Snake Assemblage Using Deep Learning.
PG  - 74-86
LID - 10.1086/708763 [doi]
AB  - Batesian mimicry is a canonical example of evolution by natural selection, 
      popularized by highly colorful species resembling unrelated models with astonishing 
      precision. However, Batesian mimicry could also occur in inconspicuous species and 
      rely on subtle resemblance. Although potentially widespread, such instances have 
      been rarely investigated, such that the real frequency of Batesian mimicry has 
      remained largely unknown. To fill this gap, we developed a new approach using deep 
      learning to quantify the visual resemblance between putative mimics and models from 
      photographs. We applied this method to Western Palearctic snakes. Potential 
      nonvenomous mimics were revealed by an excess of resemblance to sympatric venomous 
      snakes compared with random expectations. We found that 8% of the nonvenomous 
      species were potential mimics, although they resembled their models imperfectly. 
      This study is the first to quantify the frequency of Batesian mimicry in a whole 
      community of vertebrates, and it shows that even concealed species can act as 
      potential models. Our approach should prove useful for detecting mimicry in other 
      communities, and more generally it highlights the benefits of deep learning for 
      quantitative studies of phenotypic resemblance.

TI  - Touch responsiveness in zebrafish requires voltage-gated calcium channel 2.1b.
PG  - 148-59
LID - 10.1152/jn.00839.2011 [doi]
AB  - The molecular and physiological basis of the touch-unresponsive zebrafish mutant 
      fakir has remained elusive. Here we report that the fakir phenotype is caused by a 
      missense mutation in the gene encoding voltage-gated calcium channel 2.1b 
      (CACNA1Ab). Injection of RNA encoding wild-type CaV2.1 restores touch responsiveness 
      in fakir mutants, whereas knockdown of CACNA1Ab via morpholino oligonucleotides 
      recapitulates the fakir mutant phenotype. Fakir mutants display normal 
      current-evoked synaptic communication at the neuromuscular junction but have 
      attenuated touch-evoked activation of motor neurons. NMDA-evoked fictive swimming is 
      not affected by the loss of CaV2.1b, suggesting that this channel is not required 
      for motor pattern generation. These results, coupled with the expression of CACNA1Ab 
      by sensory neurons, suggest that CaV2.1b channel activity is necessary for 
      touch-evoked activation of the locomotor network in zebrafish.

TI  - Rapid upregulation of alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors by tyrosine 
      dephosphorylation.
PG  - 3712-23
AB  - Alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) modulate network activity in the 
      CNS. Thus, functional regulation of alpha7 nAChRs could influence the flow of 
      information through various brain nuclei. It is hypothesized here that these 
      receptors are amenable to modulation by tyrosine phosphorylation. In both Xenopus 
      oocytes and rat hippocampal interneurons, brief exposure to a broad-spectrum protein 
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, specifically and reversibly potentiated alpha7 
      nAChR-mediated responses, whereas a protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, 
      pervanadate, caused depression. Potentiation was associated with an increased 
      expression of surface alpha7 subunits and was not accompanied by detectable changes 
      in receptor open probability, implying that the increased function results from an 
      increased number of alpha7 nAChRs. Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor 
      attachment protein receptor-mediated exocytosis was shown to be a plausible 
      mechanism for the rapid delivery of additional alpha7 nAChRs to the plasma membrane. 
      Direct phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of alpha7 subunits was unlikely because 
      mutation of all three cytoplasmic tyrosine residues did not prevent the 
      genistein-mediated facilitation. Overall, these data are consistent with the 
      hypothesis that the number of functional cell surface alpha7 nAChRs is controlled 
      indirectly via processes involving tyrosine phosphorylation.

LID - 843787
AB  - Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) are important membrane protein carrying on the 
      molecular basis for action potentials (AP) in neuronal firings. Even though the 
      structure-function studies were the most pursued spots, the posttranslation 
      modification processes, such as glycosylation, phosphorylation, and alternative 
      splicing associating with channel functions captured less eyesights. The 
      accumulative research suggested an interaction between the sialic acids chains and 
      ion-permeable pores, giving rise to subtle but significant impacts on channel 
      gating. Sodium channel-specific neurotoxic toxins, a family of long-chain 
      polypeptides originated from venomous animals, are found to potentially share the 
      binding sites adjacent to glycosylated region on VGSCs. Thus, an interaction between 
      toxin and glycosylated VGSC might hopefully join the campaign to approach the role 
      of glycosylation in modulating VGSCs-involved neuronal network activity. This paper 
      will cover the state-of-the-art advances of researches on glycosylation-mediated 
      VGSCs function and the possible underlying mechanisms of interactions between toxin 
      and glycosylated VGSCs, which may therefore, fulfill the knowledge in identifying 
      the pharmacological targets and therapeutic values of VGSCs.

AB  - Since cancer cells have different mitochondrial bioenergetic requirements than 
      non-cancerous cells, therapeutic inhibition of its mitochondrial functionality 
      continues to be an important target for anticancer drug discovery. In this study, a 
      series of acylhydroquinones with different acyl-chain length, and their chlorinated 
      derivatives, in the aromatic ring, synthesized by Fries rearrangement under 
      microwave irradiation, were evaluated for their anticancer activity in two leukemia 
      cell lines. Findings from the primary and secondary screening of the 18 
      acylhydroquinones, tested at 5 µM on acute promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 and acute 
      lymphoblastic leukemia CEM cells lines, identified an acylchlorohydroquinone (12) 
      with a highly selective anti-proliferative effect toward HL-60 cells. This compound 
      induced S-phase arrest in the cell cycle progression of HL-60 cells with 
      insignificant toxicity on leukemic CEM cells and non-cancerous Hs27 cells. In HL-60 
      leukemic cells, 12 triggered increased mitochondrial NADH oxidation, increased 
      respiration in presence of oligomycin (state 4o), mitochondrial depolarization, and 
      ROS production, suggesting an uncoupling of OXPHOS. This provoked a metabolic 
      adaptation dependent on AMPK/ACC/autophagy axis, having the mitochondrial 
      β-oxidation a pro-survival role since the combination of 12 and etomoxir, a 
      carnitine palmitoyl-transferase (CPT) inhibitor promoted extensive HL-60 cell death. 
      Finally, 12-induced metabolic stress sensitized to HL-60 cells to cell death by the 
      FDA-approved anti-leukemic drug ABT-199, a BH3 mimetic. Therefore, our results 
      suggest that acylchlorohydroquinone is a promising scaffold in anti-promyelocytic 
      leukemia drug research.

PG  - 1528
AB  - The National University of Singapore (NUS) is one of the first medical schools in 
      Asia to exploit the use of the World Wide Web on the Internet for the delivery of 
      health information databases. Its WWW server was established in 1993 by the NUS 
      Biocomputing Research and User Support (BRUS) technology group in collaboration with 
      the Computer Resource Planning committee of the Faculty of Medicine. As a result of 
      the early recognition of the powerful platform on which health information services 
      can be delivered worldwide, the NUS effort has been accredited with a number of 
      Internet firsts in the area of health informatics. The following are some of the NUS 
      achievements: NUS-NCI CancerNet on the Web. The NUS developed and implemented the 
      first WWW version of the popular CancerNet database offered by the National Cancer 
      Institute, NIH, USA. Health Info-Com Network Medical Newsletter. The NUS developed 
      and implemented the first WWW version of the medical newsletter, MEDNEWS which is 
      edited by Dr. David Dodell, USA. It is now mirrored by the University of 
      Pennsylvania in the United States and De Montfort University, U.K. Poisons 
      Information Database. This first WWW implementation of a database on known plant, 
      snake and other animal toxins with directories of antivenoms, toxinologists and 
      poisons control centers around the world is offered by the NUS Venom and Toxin 
      Research Group. HistoNet. This is a large collection of histology specimens from the 
      NUS Department of Anatomy. MEDISTAT. This is the first WWW implementation of a 
      Health and Population Statistical Database which contains information for Singapore, 
      selected Asian countries and aggregate data for world regions. The Singapore 
      Biotechnology Database. This database features companies and organizations involved 
      in biotechnology and related activities in Singapore. Efforts are continuing to 
      offer more value-added health information databases on the NUS WWW server and to 
      link the server with other top-class information centers worldwide. Our mission is 
      to identify the National University of Singapore as a global health information hub 
      on the Internet.

TI  - Urbanization as a facilitator of gene flow in a human health pest.
LID - 10.1111/mec.14783 [doi]
AB  - Urban fragmentation can reduce gene flow that isolates populations, reduces genetic 
      diversity and increases population differentiation, all of which have negative 
      conservation implications. Alternatively, gene flow may actually be increased among 
      urban areas consistent with an urban facilitation model. In fact, urban adapter 
      pests are able to thrive in the urban environment and may be experiencing 
      human-mediated transport. Here, we used social network theory with a population 
      genetic approach to investigate the impact of urbanization on genetic connectivity 
      in the Western black widow spider, as an urban pest model of human health concern. 
      We collected genomewide single nucleotide polymorphism variation from mitochondrial 
      and nuclear double-digest RAD (ddRAD) sequence data sets from 210 individuals 
      sampled from 11 urban and 10 nonurban locales across its distribution of the Western 
      United States. From urban and nonurban contrasts of population, phylogenetic, and 
      network analyses, urban locales have higher within-population genetic diversity, 
      lower between-population genetic differentiation and higher estimates of genetic 
      connectivity. Social network analyses show that urban locales not only have more 
      connections, but can act as hubs that drive connectivity among nonurban locales, 
      which show signatures of historical isolation. These results are consistent with an 
      urban facilitation model of gene flow and demonstrate the importance of sampling 
      multiple cities and markers to identify the role that urbanization has had on larger 
      spatial scales. As the urban landscape continues to grow, this approach will help 
      determine what factors influence the spread and adaptation of pests, like the 
      venomous black widow spider, in building policies for human and biodiversity health.

AB  - Although experimental protein-structure determination usually targets known 
      proteins, chains of unknown sequence are often encountered. They can be purified 
      from natural sources, appear as an unexpected fragment of a well characterized 
      protein or appear as a contaminant. Regardless of the source of the problem, the 
      unknown protein always requires characterization. Here, an automated pipeline is 
      presented for the identification of protein sequences from cryo-EM reconstructions 
      and crystallographic data. The method's application to characterize the crystal 
      structure of an unknown protein purified from a snake venom is presented. It is also 
      shown that the approach can be successfully applied to the identification of protein 
      sequences and validation of sequence assignments in cryo-EM protein structures.

AB  - EPPIN is a sperm-surface drug target for male contraception. Here we investigated 
      EPPIN-interacting proteins in mouse spermatozoa. We showed that EPPIN is an 
      androgen-dependent gene, expressed in the testis and epididymis, but also present in 
      the vas deferens, seminal vesicle and adrenal gland. Mature spermatozoa presented 
      EPPIN staining on the head and flagellum. Immunoprecipitation of EPPIN from 
      spermatozoa pre-incubated with seminal vesicle fluid (SVF) followed by LC-MS/MS or 
      Western blot revealed the co-immunoprecipitation of SVS2, SVS3A, SVS5 and SVS6. In 
      silico and Far-Western blot approaches demonstrated that EPPIN binds SVS2 in a 
      protein network with other SVS proteins. Immunofluorescence using spermatozoa 
      pre-incubated with SVF or recombinant SVS2 demonstrated the co-localization of EPPIN 
      and SVS2 both on sperm head and flagellum. Our data show that EPPIN's roles in sperm 
      function are conserved between mouse and human, demonstrating that the mouse is a 
      suitable experimental model for translational studies on EPPIN.

AB  - The paper gives the results of observations of 1558 patients before and after 
      tourist travels to tropical countries and 368 individuals visiting the north areas 
      of the Russian Federation. Different conditions (malaria, amebiasis, leishmaniasis, 
      intestinal and tissue helminthiasis, insect bites, venomous fish pricks, medusa 
      burn, tick bites, etc.) were found in 402 persons. Prophylactic immunization 
      included vaccination against hepatitis A and B viruses, meningitis, typhus, yellow 
      fever, tick-borne encephalitis in more than 2500 patients (not including influenza 
      vaccination in the epidemic season). The performed observations reinforce the 
      statement that imported pathology is urgent to Russia and suggest that it is 
      necessary to develop this section of medicine and to set up a network of health care 
      facilities with a necessary therapeutic and diagnostic base to render skilled care 
      to tourists. It is essential to improve medical staff training in travel medicine.

TI  - New trends in anaphylaxis.
PG  - 295-300
LID - 10.1007/s40629-017-0042-y [doi]
AB  - This review presents the current trends in anaphylaxis management discussed at the 
      fourth International Network for Online-Registration of Anaphylaxis (NORA) 
      conference held in Berlin in April 2017. Current data from the anaphylaxis registry 
      show that Hymenoptera venom, foods, and pharmaceutical drugs are still among the 
      most frequent triggers of anaphylaxis. Rare triggers include chicory, cardamom, 
      asparagus, and goji berries. A meta-analysis on recent trends in insect venom 
      anaphylaxis demonstrated for the first time that, although data on the efficacy of 
      insect venom immunotherapy is limited, the occurrence of severe reactions upon 
      repeated sting events can be prevented and patients' quality of life improved. 
      Molecular diagnostics of insect venom anaphylaxis have significantly improved 
      diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. Self-treatment of anaphylaxis is of great 
      importance. Recent data from the anaphylaxis registry show an increase (from 23% in 
      2012 to 29% in 2016) in the use of adrenaline as recommended in the guidelines. 
      A survey on the implementation of guidelines conducted among the centers reporting 
      to the anaphylaxis registry highlights the extent to which the guideline has been 
      perceived and implemented. Reports on a variety of cases in the anaphylaxis registry 
      illustrate the diversity of this potentially life-threatening reaction. 
      Component-resolved diagnostics can help to specify sensitization profiles in 
      anaphylaxis, particularly in terms of the risk for severe reactions. Recent studies

AB  - Voltage-sensor domains (VSDs) are modular transmembrane domains of voltage-gated ion 
      channels that respond to changes in membrane potential by undergoing conformational 
      changes that are coupled to gating of the ion-conducting pore. Most spider-venom 
      peptides function as gating modifiers by binding to the VSDs of voltage-gated 
      channels and trapping them in a closed or open state. To understand the molecular 
      basis underlying this mode of action, we used nuclear magnetic resonance to 
      delineate the atomic details of the interaction between the VSD of the voltage-gated 
      potassium channel KvAP and the spider-venom peptide VSTx1. Our data reveal that the 
      toxin interacts with residues in an aqueous cleft formed between the extracellular 
      S1-S2 and S3-S4 loops of the VSD whilst maintaining lipid interactions in the gaps 
      formed between the S1-S4 and S2-S3 helices. The resulting network of interactions 
      increases the energetic barrier to the conformational changes required for channel 
      gating, and we propose that this is the mechanism by which gating modifier toxins 
      inhibit voltage-gated ion channels.

AB  - Unfolding stabilities of two homologous proteins, cardiotoxin III and 
      short-neurotoxin (SNTX) belonging to three-finger toxin (TFT) superfamily, have been 
      probed by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Combined analysis of data 
      obtained from steered MD and all-atom MD simulations at various temperatures in near 
      physiological conditions on the proteins suggested that overall structural 
      stabilities of the two proteins were different from each other and the MD results 
      are consistent with experimental data of the proteins reported in the literature. 
      Rationalization for the differential structural stabilities of the structurally 
      similar proteins has been chiefly attributed to the differences in the structural 
      contacts between C- and N-termini regions in their three-dimensional structures, and 
      the findings endorse the 'CN network' hypothesis proposed to qualitatively analyse 
      the thermodynamic stabilities of proteins belonging to TFT superfamily of snake 
      venoms. Moreover, the 'CN network' hypothesis has been revisited and the present 
      study suggested that 'CN network' should be accounted in terms of 'structural 
      contacts' and 'structural strengths' in order to precisely describe order of 
      structural stabilities of TFTs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Synthetic compounds with pharmaceutical applications in brain disorders 
      are daily designed and synthesized, with well first effects but also seldom severe 
      side effects. This imposes the search for alternative therapies based on the 
      pharmaceutical potentials of natural compounds. The natural compounds isolated from 
      various plants and arthropods venom are well known for their antimicrobial 
      (antibacterial, antiviral) and antiinflammatory activities, but more studies are 
      needed for a better understanding of their structural and pharmacological features 
      with new therapeutic applications. OBJECTIVES: Here we present some structural and 
      pharmaceutical features of natural compounds isolated from plants and arthropods 
      venom relevant for their efficiency and potency in brain disorders. We present the 
      polytherapeutic effects of natural compounds belonging to terpenes (limonene), 
      monoterpenoids (1,8-cineole) and stilbenes (resveratrol), as well as natural 
      peptides (apamin, mastoparan and melittin). METHODS: Various experimental and in 
      silico methods are presented with special attention on bioinformatics (natural 
      compounds database, artificial neural network) and cheminformatics (QSAR, drug 
      design, computational mutagenesis, molecular docking). RESULTS: In the present paper 
      we reviewed: (i) recent studies regarding the pharmacological potential of natural 
      compounds in the brain; (ii) the most useful databases containing molecular and 
      functional features of natural compounds; and (iii) the most important molecular 
      descriptors of natural compounds in comparison with a few synthetic compounds. 
      CONCLUSION: Our paper indicates that natural compounds are a real alternative for 
      nervous system therapy and represents a helpful tool for the future papers focused 
      on the study of the natural compounds.

TI  - Uncovering the Mechanisms of Chinese Herbal Medicine (MaZiRenWan) for Functional 
      Constipation by Focused Network Pharmacology Approach.

LID - 270
AB  - MaZiRenWan (MZRW, also known as Hemp Seed Pill) is a Chinese Herbal Medicine which 
      has been demonstrated to safely and effectively alleviate functional constipation 
      (FC) in a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study with 120 subjects. However, 
      the underlying pharmacological actions of MZRW for FC, are still largely unknown. We 
      systematically analyzed the bioactive compounds of MZRW and mechanism-of-action 
      biological targets through a novel approach called "focused network pharmacology." 
      Among the 97 compounds identified by UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS in MZRW extract, 34 were found 
      in rat plasma, while 10 were found in rat feces. Hierarchical clustering analysis 
      suggest that these compounds can be classified into component groups, in which 
      compounds are highly similar to each other and most of them are from the same herb. 
      Emodin, amygdalin, albiflorin, honokiol, and naringin were selected as 
      representative compounds of corresponding component groups. All of them were shown 
      to induce spontaneous contractions of rat colonic smooth muscle in vitro. Network 
      analysis revealed that biological targets in acetylcholine-, estrogen-, 
      prostaglandin-, cannabinoid-, and purine signaling pathways are able to explain the 
      prokinetic effects of representative compounds and corresponding component groups. 
      In conclusion, MZRW active components enhance colonic motility, possibly by acting 
      on multiple targets and pathways.

TI  - Report of Non-Lyme, Erythema Migrans Rashes from New Jersey with a Review of 
      Possible Role of Tick Salivary Toxins.
PG  - 641-652
LID - 10.1089/vbz.2018.2278 [doi]
AB  - Erythema migrans (EM) rashes once considered pathognomonic of Lyme disease (LD) have 
      been reported following bites of arthropods that do not transmit LD and in areas 
      with no LD. Also, EM rashes have been reported in association with organisms other 
      than members of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex. Arthropod saliva has 
      chemicals that have effects on the host and pathogen transmission. Tick saliva has 
      protein families similar to spiders and scorpions and even substances homologous to 
      those found in snakes and other venomous animals. Ticks "invertebrate 
      pharmacologists" have a sophisticated arsenal of chemicals that assist in blood 
      feeding, pathogen transmission, and suppressing host defenses. No organisms have 
      been isolated from many EM rashes. We propose that tick salivary toxins may play a 
      role in the causation of rashes and laboratory abnormalities in tick-borne diseases. 
      The role of tick salivary toxins needs further exploration. Cases of Lyme-like EM 
      rashes referred to as STARI (Southern Tick-Associated Rash Illness) following bites 
      of the lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum, in the United States have been reported 
      predominantly in Southeastern Missouri and a few in South Carolina, North Carolina, 
      Georgia, and one case each in Mississippi and Long Island, New York. Although there 
      is one report of Borrelia lonestari in a patient with a rash, biopsies of 31 cases 
      of STARI, with cultures and PCR, failed to show a relationship. Distribution of A. 
      americanum, whose bites are associated with STARI, now extends along the East Coast 
      of the United States, including New Jersey, up to the Canadian border. As far as we 
      are aware, there have been no prior reports of Lyme-like rashes in New Jersey. In 
      this study, we present case examples of 2 Lyme-like rashes, variations of EM rashes, 
      and a brief review of studies that suggest a role of tick salivary toxins in 
      tick-borne diseases.

TI  - Bufalin inhibits endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis in vitro.
PG  - 127-34
AB  - We have investigated the effects of bufalin, one of the prominent components in 
      Chinese toad venom, on proliferation of bovine aortic endothelial (BAE) cells and 
      tube formation in three-dimensional type I collagen matrix. In the present study, 
      bufalin potently inhibited the formation of capillary-like tubular networks in a 
      dose-dependent manner. Bufalin also inhibited the proliferation of BAE cells at the 
      same concentration (5 nM) that the tube formation was inhibited. As a potent 
      inhibitor of endothelial cell proliferation, bufalin specifically prevented the 
      entry of BAE cells into the G0/G1 phase of a cell cycle. These findings suggest that 
      in vitro angioinhibitory action of bufalin may be induced by the proliferation 
      inhibition of endothelial cells through the arrest at the G2/M phase of a cell 
      cycle.

TI  - Algorithm for the diagnosis of anaphylaxis and its validation using population-based 
      data on emergency department visits for anaphylaxis in Florida.
PG  - 98-104.e4
LID - 10.1016/j.jaci.2010.04.017 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies of anaphylaxis have been limited by significant 
      underdiagnosis. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a 
      method for capturing previously unidentified anaphylaxis cases by using 
      International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification 
      (ICD-9-CM) based datasets. METHODS: Florida emergency department data for the years 
      2005 and 2006 from the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration were used. 
      Patients with anaphylaxis were identified by using ICD-9-CM codes specifically 
      indicating anaphylaxis or an ICD-9-CM algorithm based on the definition of 
      anaphylaxis proposed at the 2005 National Institute of Allergy and Infectious 
      Disease and the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network symposium. Cases ascertained 
      with the algorithm were compared with the traditional case-ascertainment method. 
      Comparisons included demographic and clinical risk factors, proportion of monthly 
      visits, and age/sex-specific rates. Cases ascertained with anaphylaxis ICD-9-CM 
      codes were excluded from those ascertained with the algorithm. RESULTS: One thousand 
      one hundred forty-nine patients were identified by using anaphylaxis ICD-9-CM codes, 
      and 1,602 patients were identified with the algorithm. The clinical risk factors and 
      demographics of cases were consistent between the 2 methods. However, the algorithm 
      was more likely to identify older subjects (P < .0001), those with hypertension or 
      heart disease (P < .0001), and subjects with venom-induced anaphylaxis (P < .0001). 
      CONCLUSION: This study introduces and validates an ICD-9-CM-based diagnostic 
      algorithm for the diagnosis of anaphylaxis to capture subjects missed by using the 
      ICD-9-CM anaphylaxis codes. Fifty-eight percent of anaphylaxis cases would be missed 
      without the use of the algorithm, including 88% of venom-induced cases.

AB  - GeneChip microarray is a cutting-edge technology being used to study the expression 
      patterns of genes with in a particular cell type. In this study, the Affymetrix 
      RAE230A platform was used to profile stably expressed mRNA transcripts from PC12 
      cells at passage 5 and 15. The whole-cell PC12 transcriptome revealed that a total 
      of 7,531 stable transcripts (P < 0.05), corresponding to 6,785 genes, were found to 
      be consistently expressed between passage 5 and 15. The data analysis revealed 3,080 
      functional proteins, belonging to 13 families, which indicate that about 65% of the 
      proteins expressed in PC12 cells are uncharacterized. By using our custom-built rat 
      neuronal reference genome database, we mapped endogenously expressed stable neuronal 
      transcripts from PC12 cells comprising about 765 genes responsible for neuronal 
      function and disease. These neuronal transcripts were further analyzed to provide a 
      genetic blueprint that can be used by neurobiologist to unravel the complex cellular 
      and molecular mechanisms underlying biological functions and their associated 
      signalling networks for diseases affecting the nervous system.

      Network Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.
LID - 10.3390/healthcare9111502 [doi]
LID - 1502
AB  - We aimed to compare the effectiveness of some different acupuncture modalities on 
      motor function using the unified Parkinson disease rating scale (UPDRS)-III scores 
      of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) via pairwise and network meta-analyses (NMA) 
      of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool 
      was used to assess the methodological quality of the included RCTs. A frequentist 
      approach-based random effect model NMA was performed. Seventeen RCTs with 1071 
      participants were included. The five following modalities were identified: 
      combination of conventional medication (levodopa) with (1) electroacupuncture 
      (ELEC), (2) manual acupuncture (MANU), (3) bee venom acupuncture (BEEV), (4) sham 
      acupuncture (SHAM), and (5) conventional medication alone (CONV). In NMA on 
      UPDRS-III, BEEV was the best modality compared to CONV (mean difference [MD]) -7.37, 
      95% confidence interval [-11.97, -2.77]). The comparative ranking assessed through 
      NMA was suggested to be BEEV, MANU, ELEC, SHAM, and CONV. Regarding daily activity 
      assessment (UPDRS-II), the magnitude of effectiveness was in the order of BEEV, 
      ELEC, MANU, SHAM, and CONV. Combination treatment with BEEV (MANU or ELEC) and CONV 
      can be recommended to improve motor function in PD patients. Due to the limited 
      number of included RCTs, further NMA with more rigorous RCTs are warranted.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Anecdotal media reports suggest an increase in snakebites after 
      hurricanes. After Hurricane Harvey, several households called Texas poison control 
      centers to report snakebites that occurred when rising water flooded homes. Patterns 
      of snakebite before and after hurricane landfalls have not been well studied. 
      METHODS: We reviewed retrospective surveillance data from the Texas Poison Control 
      Network to examine snakebites possibly related to tropical storms/hurricanes that 
      hit Texas between 2000 and 2017. For that assessment, we compared 2 groups of 
      counties: those designated for individual assistance (impact counties) by the 
      Federal Emergency Management Agency and all others (nonimpact counties). Typically, 
      counties with individual assistance declarations are those in which damage is worse 
      and resident return may be delayed. RESULTS: Eleven named tropical storms/hurricanes 
      struck Texas between 2000 and 2017; 9 received individual assistance declarations. 
      During the 18 y, 2037 snakebites were reported in the 30 d after and the 30 d before 
      landfalls in 9 storms; 132 (6%) occurred poststorm in impact counties, and 13 of 132 
      (9%) of the case narratives mentioned hurricanes as a contributing factor. Impact 
      counties were not statistically more likely to report snakebites in the 30 d after 
      landfall for any of the 9 storms or overall, nor did we find differences in patient 
      demographic characteristics, type of snake, and care patterns post- and prestorm. 
      CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of increases in snakebites after hurricanes in 
      Texas during the study period. More detailed evaluations may be warranted in other 
      regions that experience hurricanes and have venomous snake populations.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of the current review is to highlight the most recent 
      findings in molecular allergy and its applicability in precision medicine for 
      allergic patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Molecular allergy provides useful information in 
      areas of respiratory allergy (house dust mites, pet dander and pollen allergy), food 
      allergy (tree nuts, peanuts, fruits and vegetables), hymenoptera venom allergy and 
      others, in order to improve management of patients. Regional differences in 
      sensitization profiles, assay characteristics and interpretation of molecular 
      sensitization in relation to whole extracts and total immunoglobulin E need to be 
      taken into account. Studies of the impact of such strategies are needed. SUMMARY: 
      Molecular allergy diagnosis represents a major contribution for personalized 
      medicine. It aids in the assesment of risk prediction, disease severity, 
      genuine/cross-reactive sensitization, and finally to apply precise management 
      strategies.

TI  - Human mast cells and mastocytosis: harnessing microRNA expression as a new approach 
      to therapy?
PG  - 279-86
LID - 10.1007/s00005-010-0086-x [doi]
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, non-coding RNAs that have emerged as key 
      post-transcriptional regulators in a wide variety of organisms and critical cellular 
      processes. Because any one miRNA can regulate the expression of a distinct set of 
      genes, differential miRNA expression can shape the repertoire of proteins that are 
      actually expressed during development, differentiation, or disease. To understand 
      what goes wrong when a cell becomes transformed requires knowledge of the processes 
      that ensure normal development. It is now clear that miRNAs may act as oncogenes 
      and/or tumor suppressors within gene regulatory networks, thereby contributing to 
      the development of cancer. Mast cells are long-lived cells, widely distributed 
      throughout vascularized tissues, in particular near surfaces that are exposed to the 
      environment (such as skin, airways, and the gastrointestinal tract), where they 
      contribute to bacterial clearance, enhancement of adaptive immune responses, 
      modulation of inflammation, and the degradation of toxic peptides and venoms. Here 
      we review current knowledge in the field of mast-cell differentiation and disease in 
      humans and mice and discuss future directions and links between mast-cell 
      differentiation, oncogenic transformation, and microRNAs as well as possible new 
      points of entry for therapeutic intervention.

TI  - Funnel Web Spider Toxicity.
BTI - StatPearls
AB  - There are over 40 species of funnel-web spiders, with 3 genera restricted to 
      Australia, including the Hadronyche, Illawarra, and the Atrax.  Of all Australian 
      spiders, one species of the Atrax genera, the Atrax robustus, is implicated in the 
      most human fatalities. The Atrax robustus is known as the Sydney funnel-web spider 
      and is native to eastern Australia. Funnel-web spiders are medium to large in size 
      and are dark in color, ranging from black to brown. Funnel-web spiders get their 
      name from their funnel-shaped burrows they spin to trap prey. These spiders reside 
      in cool and relatively sheltered habitats. They are often found under rocks or in 
      rock gardens, in various shrubberies, or under logs. Some funnel web spiders even 
      reside in trees, sometimes several meters in the air. The bite of the Sydney 
      funnel-web spider is potentially deadly, but since the development of the antivenom 
      in 1981 and the advancement of modern first aid techniques, there has been only 1 
      death associated with this spider's bite and was likely a result of a delayed 
      presentation. Funnel-web spiders have powerful, sharp fangs that have been known to 
      penetrate fingernails and soft shoes. They are known to be the most dangerous 
      spiders in the world. The silk entrance to the burrow of a Sydney funnel-web spider 
      has a "vestibule-like" structure, and the spider sits just within the vestibule and 
      senses vibrations along the silk "trip lines" and reacts to inject venom into its 
      prey. The tree-dwelling funnel-web spiders can reach 4 to 5 cm in length, with the 
      largest species being the Northern Tree Funnel Web Spider.

TI  - Cell adhesion molecule 1 is a novel pancreatic-islet cell adhesion molecule that 
      mediates nerve-islet cell interactions.
PG  - 1544-54
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2008.01.081 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1), mediates nerve-mast cell 
      attachment and communication through homophilic binding. An immunohistochemical 
      screen showed that CADM1 is expressed in pancreatic islets. Here, we determined the 
      cell types expressing CADM1 and examined its role in nerve-islet cell interactions. 
      METHODS: Immunohistochemistry and double-staining immunofluorescence were performed 
      on murine and human pancreases and on islet cell tumors (ICTs). alphaTC6 cells, a 
      murine alpha cell line, were cultured on neurite networks of superior cervical 
      ganglia. Neurite-alphaTC6 cell attachment and communication were examined after 
      nerves were activated specifically by scorpion venom. RESULTS: CADM1 was expressed 
      on the plasma membrane in all 4 major types of islet cells, alpha, beta, D, and 
      pancreatic polypeptide in human beings, but primarily in alpha cells in mice. In 
      cocultures, alphaTC6 cell to neurite attachment was inhibited dose-dependently by an 
      anti-CADM1 function-blocking antibody. In response to scorpion venom-evoked nerve 
      activation, 36% of the alphaTC6 cells mobilized Ca(2+), and introduction of a 
      CADM1-targeting small interfering RNA reduced the fraction of responding cells to 
      7%. In 21 human ICTs, CADM1 was present in the plasma membrane of 7, and the others 
      were negative for CADM1. Six of the CADM1-expressing tumors were functional 
      hormonally, whereas all but 2 of the CADM1-negative tumors were nonfunctional (P = 
      .0032). CONCLUSIONS: CADM1 is a novel islet cell adhesion molecule mediating 
      nerve-islet cell interactions. The strong correlation between CADM1 expression and 
      hormonally functional phenotypes suggests that CADM1 is involved in hormone 
      secretion from ICTs.

AB  - A defining characteristic of eusocial animals is their division of labour into 
      reproductive and nonreproductive specialists. Here, we used a microarray study to 
      identify genes associated with functional sterility in the worker honey bee Apis 
      mellifera. We contrasted gene expression in workers from a functionally sterile 
      wild-type strain with that in a mutant (anarchist) strain selected for high rates of 
      ovary activation. We identified a small set of genes from the brain (n = 7) and from 
      the abdomen (n = 5) that are correlated in their expression with early stages of 
      ovary activation. Sterile wild-type workers up-regulated two unknown genes and a 
      homologue of Drosophila CG6004. By contrast, reproductive anarchist workers 
      up-regulated genes for the yolk protein vitellogenin, venom peptides and a member of 
      the AdoHycase superfamily, among others. The differentially expressed genes 
      identified are likely to be involved in early differentiation into sterile and 
      reproductive worker phenotypes and may therefore form part of the gene networks 
      associated with the regulation of honey bee worker sterility. Our study may have 
      lacked sufficient power to detect all but a minority of biologically relevant 
      changes taking place; however, the differential expression of vitellogenin and a 
      putative AdoHycase suggests that our screen has captured core reproductive genes and 
      that ovary activation may involve an epigenetic mechanism.

TI  - Basal serum tryptase is not a risk factor for immediate-type drug hypersensitivity 
      during childhood.
PG  - 736-742
LID - 10.1111/pai.12604 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: High serum basal tryptase (sBT) levels have been identified as a risk 
      factor for both venom- and food-induced severe allergic reactions. The aim of this 
      study was to compare sBT levels in children with different severity of actual drug 
      hypersensitivity reactions (DHRs) with those of age- and sex-matched controls 
      without any history of DHRs. METHOD: Patients between 0 and 18 years of age with a 
      history of immediate-type DHRs manifested in 0-6 h after the culprit drug intake 
      were included. Following ENDA (European Network for Drug Allergy) inquiries, 
      patients were evaluated with skin and/or provocation tests to define the actual 
      drug-hypersensitive patients. Serum BT levels were determined for both patients and 
      controls. RESULTS: Of 345 children, 106 patients (30.7%) [(58.5% male), median age 
      (interquartile range) 8.0 years (4.2-12.2)] were diagnosed as drug hypersensitive. 
      Ninety-eight controls were also included. The sBT levels of drug-hypersensitive 
      patients with and without anaphylaxis and the control group were similar [2.6 
      (2.0-3.6) μg/l vs. 2.8 (1.6-4.3) μg/l vs. 2.6 (1.8-3.6) μg/l, respectively, (p > 
      0.05)]. The sBT levels of the patients with sole cutaneous symptoms 2.8 (1.6-4.3) 
      μg/l, mild anaphylaxis 3.0 (1.9-4.9) μg/l, and moderate-to-severe anaphylaxis 2.6 
      (2.0-3.6) μg/l were also comparable (p > 0.05). The onset of DHRs [those occurring 
      in 1 h (n = 87) or in 1-6 h (n = 19) after the drug intake], positive results with 
      skin tests with the culprit drug, or the classification of the patients according to 
      different age groups [(0-2 years), (2-6 years), (6-12 years), (12-18 years)] did not 
      correlate with sBT levels. CONCLUSION: The sBT levels in children with actual drug 
      hypersensitivity would not be a risk factor for severe systemic reactions on the 
      contrary to children with allergic reactions to food or insect venom.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in the world. Platelets have 
      a major role in cardiovascular events as they bind to the damaged endothelium 
      activating and forming thrombi. Although some hydroquinone scaffold-containing 
      compounds have known antiplatelet activities, currently there is a lack of evidence 
      on the antiplatelet activity of hydroquinones carrying electron attractor groups. In 
      this work, we evaluate the antiplatelet effect of a series of ortho-carbonyl 
      hydroquinone derivatives on cytotoxicity and function of human platelets, using 
      collagen and thrombin receptor activator peptide 6 (TRAP-6) as agonists. Our 
      structure-activity relationship study shows that gem-diethyl/methyl substitutions 
      and the addition/modifications of the third ring of ortho-carbonyl hydroquinone 
      scaffold influence on the selective index (IC(50) TRAP-6/IC(50) Collagen) and the 
      inhibitory capacity of platelet aggregation. Compounds 3 and 8 inhibit 
      agonist-induced platelet aggregation in a non-competitive manner with IC(50) values 
      of 1.77 ± 2.09 μM (collagen) and 11.88 ± 4.59 μM (TRAP-6), respectively and show no 
      cytotoxicity. Both compounds do not affect intracellular calcium levels and 
      mitochondrial bioenergetics. Consistently, they reduce the expression of P-selectin, 
      activation of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa, and release of adenosine triphosphate and CD63 
      from platelet. Our findings may be used for further development of new drugs in 
      platelet-related thrombosis diseases.

TI  - High-throughput screening for small-molecule modulators of inward rectifier 
      potassium channels.
LID - 4209 [pii]
LID - 10.3791/4209 [doi]
AB  - Specific members of the inward rectifier potassium (Kir) channel family are 
      postulated drug targets for a variety of disorders, including hypertension, atrial 
      fibrillation, and pain. For the most part, however, progress toward understanding 
      their therapeutic potential or even basic physiological functions has been slowed by 
      the lack of good pharmacological tools. Indeed, the molecular pharmacology of the 
      inward rectifier family has lagged far behind that of the S4 superfamily of 
      voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels, for which a number of nanomolar-affinity and 
      highly selective peptide toxin modulators have been discovered. The bee venom toxin 
      tertiapin and its derivatives are potent inhibitors of Kir1.1 and Kir3 channels, but 
      peptides are of limited use therapeutically as well as experimentally due to their 
      antigenic properties and poor bioavailability, metabolic stability and tissue 
      penetrance. The development of potent and selective small-molecule probes with 
      improved pharmacological properties will be a key to fully understanding the 
      physiology and therapeutic potential of Kir channels. The Molecular Libraries Probes 
      Production Center Network (MLPCN) supported by the National Institutes of Health 
      (NIH) Common Fund has created opportunities for academic scientists to initiate 
      probe discovery campaigns for molecular targets and signaling pathways in need of 
      better pharmacology. The MLPCN provides researchers access to industry-scale 
      screening centers and medicinal chemistry and informatics support to develop 
      small-molecule probes to elucidate the function of genes and gene networks. The 
      critical step in gaining entry to the MLPCN is the development of a robust target- 
      or pathway-specific assay that is amenable for high-throughput screening (HTS). 
      Here, we describe how to develop a fluorescence-based thallium (Tl(+)) flux assay of 
      Kir channel function for high-throughput compound screening. The assay is based on 
      the permeability of the K(+) channel pore to the K(+) congener Tl(+). A commercially 
      available fluorescent Tl(+) reporter dye is used to detect transmembrane flux of 
      Tl(+) through the pore. There are at least three commercially available dyes that 
      are suitable for Tl(+) flux assays: BTC, FluoZin-2, and FluxOR. This protocol 
      describes assay development using FluoZin-2. Although originally developed and 
      marketed as a zinc indicator, FluoZin-2 exhibits a robust and dose-dependent 
      increase in fluorescence emission upon Tl(+) binding. We began working with 
      FluoZin-2 before FluxOR was available and have continued to do so. However, the 
      steps in assay development are essentially identical for all three dyes, and users 
      should determine which dye is most appropriate for their specific needs. We also 
      discuss the assay's performance benchmarks that must be reached to be considered for 
      entry to the MLPCN. Since Tl(+) readily permeates most K(+) channels, the assay 
      should be adaptable to most K(+) channel targets.

PG  - 286-90
AB  - If seafood poisonings are well documented in the Pacific region, they are not often 
      reported in the Indian Ocean. In Madagascar, fishermen and people living in coastal 
      areas are traditionally aware of seafood poisonings. Mass intoxications were 
      described in the sixties, including lethal cases following sardine ingestion. From 
      1989 to 1993, 28 ichtyosarcotoxism cases, mainly ciguatera occurring in children, 
      were reported in Tulear hospital. From July 1993 to May 1996, nine seafood poisoning 
      outbreaks occurred in coastal villages after turtle, shark and sardine meals. 
      Clinical symptoms were related to marine toxins. For turtle intoxications, 
      gastro-intestinal symptoms are the most frequently seen (acute stomatitis, 
      dysphagia, vomiting and diarrhea), with case fatality rates around 7%. For shark 
      intoxications, the most frequent symptoms were neurologic (paresthesia specially 
      peribuccal and extremities), and gastro-intestinal (diarrhea and vomiting), with 
      specific case fatality rates varying from 0% to 30%. For sardine intoxication, 
      symptoms were gastro-intestinal (vomiting) and neurologic (paresthesia), and from 
      the two intoxicated people one died. Two previously unknown biotoxins were isolated 
      from the liver of a shark responsible for a mass poisoning, namely carchatoxins. For 
      the turtles, the search of chelonitoxin is under way. For the sardines, clupeotoxin 
      was isolated. Because of the frequency and the gravity of collective seafood 
      poisonings occurring in recent years, the Ministry of Health has implemented a 
      Seafood Poisoning National Control Programme. This programme is based on three major 
      strategies: the setting of an epidemiological surveillance network, the prevention 
      of the communities through educational programmes, and the development of research 
      on marine eco-environment.

TI  - [Pre-hospital treatment of ophidian accidents: review, update, and current 
      problems].
PG  - 195-208
AB  - Mythic, out-dated, ambiguous and sometimes iatrogenic procedures, still remain in 
      pre-hospital and hospital ophidian accident treatment. Errors, omissions and 
      ignorance make ophidian accidents appear more dangerous than they truly are, 
      resulting in a general public contempt toward snakes. Here we present an updated 
      review of current knowledge on pre-hospital and hospital treatment of ophidian bite 
      incidents, including indications, recommendations and logic errors. We describe an 
      appropriate treatment for native Mexican poisonous snakebites using fabotherapics, 
      based on our experience. Adequate initial pre-hospital and hospital management is 
      crucial for a successful outcome of this medical emergency. We describe the state of 
      the art in snake bite research discussing those procedures where research is needed 
      to implement them either by the patient, first responders, paramedics and doctors. 
      We suggest proposals to achieve even more efficient management of fabotherapics 
      based on support networks. Finally, we emphasize prevention as the main subject of 
      venom bite treatment, as it is always more adequate and economic to invest in 
      prevention than to spend on mitigation during emergency and recovery.

AB  - The authors present a summary of the proceedings and the recommendations of the the 
      4th International Conference on Envenomations by Snakebites and Scorpion Stings in 
      Africa, held from April 25th to 29th in Dakar. After a two day training workshop for 
      Senegalese health personnel on the most relevant aspects of the management of 
      envenomations, about 270 participants met to share their experiences in the field. 
      Nearly a hundred oral and poster contributions concerning the epidemiology of 
      snakebites and scorpion stings in Africa, the composition and action of venoms, as 
      well as the manufacture and use of antivenoms, were presented and discussed. The 
      last day was devoted to an institutional debate joining experts, representatives of 
      national health authorities and concerned professionals (physicians, pharmacists, 
      nurses and traditional healers) as well as members of the pharmaceutical industry, 
      to discuss and elaborate a set of recommendations. It was agreed that it is 
      necessary to improve knowledge of the epidemiological situation by case reporting. 
      Quality control of anivenoms and procedures for their registration at the level of 
      national health authorities should aim at improving the distribution of safe and 
      effective antivenoms in peripheral health centers, which bear the heaviest burden of 
      cases. It was also recommended that adequate training of health personnel in all 
      aspects of medical management of envenomations should constitute a priority. 
      Finally, financing mechanisms to ensure an equitable distribution of resources must 
      be sought, as well as the constitution of a network of African experts were 
      discussed at length.

TI  - Critical role of W60d in thrombin allostery.
PG  - 103-9
AB  - Mutation of residue W60d of thrombin, located 17 A from the Na+ binding site, 
      suppresses Na+ binding and the functional differences between the slow and fast 
      forms. The molecular basis for the long-range effect of this mutation is provided by 
      a conspicuous network of water molecules which connects the Na+ binding environment 
      to the specificity sites S1 and S2 of the enzyme. The mutation appears to stabilize 
      thrombin in a hybrid conformation that is overall similar to the slow form, but with 
      the fibrinogen recognition site functioning as in the fast form. It also affects the 
      switch in specificity from fibrinogen to protein C linked to the release Na+ and the 
      fast-->slow conversion. Under physiological conditions of pH, temperature and NaCl 
      concentration, the W60dS mutant behaves as an anticoagulant. It has a reduced 
      activity toward fibrinogen by 22-fold, while the reduction of protein C activation 
      in the presence of saturating concentrations of thrombomodulin is less than 2-fold. 
      Even more remarkable is the cleavage of fibrin I monomer leading to release of 
      fibrinopeptide B, which is reduced by more than 130-fold. This property is 
      reminiscent of the snake venom ancrod, which only releases fibrinopeptide A, and 
      adds substantially to the anticoagulant potency of the W60dS mutant. In fact, the 
      clotting time in the presence of this mutant is prolonged more than 40-fold compared 
      to the wild-type.

TI  - Dumbbell-Shaped Ossicles Discovered in Pedicellaria of Flower Sea Urchins.
PG  - 92-98
LID - 10.2108/zs170109 [doi]
AB  - Sea urchins have a globiferous pedicellaria that stands from a test with a stalk on 
      which lies a head made of three movable jaws with venom-injecting teeth. The 
      globiferous pedicellariae of the flower sea urchin Toxopneustes pileolus, one of the 
      most developed among sea urchins, are unique in that the jaws are provided with a 
      jaw membrane that gives the pedicellaria an appearance of a flower when the jaws are 
      open. We observed this membrane in an ionic liquid that does not require processes, 
      such as fixation, dehydration, or coating with conductive materials, for observation 
      with a scanning electron microscope. Using this technique, we discovered 
      dumbbell-shaped ossicles, which consist of two spheres of similar size connected by 
      a cylinder. The diameter of the sphere is 4-8 µm, and the total length of the 
      ossicle is 10-20 µm. The jaw membrane is trimmed with an edge zone. The ossicles 
      were found sparsely in the connective tissue of general part of the membrane, but in 
      the edge zone their density was so high that neighboring ossicles were in close 
      contact with each other. Some neighboring ossicles crossed their cylinders and some 
      inserted one of their spheres to snugly fit in the gap between the spheres of 
      neighboring ossicles. Their structural role is very likely in strengthening the jaw 
      membrane, probably serving as fillers in the general part of the membrane; in the 
      edge zone the interlocking of adjacent ossicles forms a loose network providing a 
      firm frame for the head of the globiferous pedicellaria. When opened, the stiff 
      frame prevents the membrane from sagging. When clasped, it works as a closed door, 
      firmly keeping prey trapped.

TI  - Drug allergy in mast cell disease.
PG  - 354-60
LID - 10.1097/ACI.0b013e328355b7cb [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Mastocytosis in adults is associated with a history of 
      anaphylaxis in 22-49%. In addition, monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome has 
      been described presenting with anaphylaxis, especially in patients with hymenoptera 
      venom anaphylaxis. Data on patients with drug hypersensitivity and mast cell 
      diseases are scarce. RECENT FINDINGS: Drugs are elicitors of anaphylaxis in patients 
      with mastocytosis. Drug hypersensitivity is only seldom described as associated with 
      undetected mast cell disease in the literature. Together with a single-centred 
      retrospective study, this data suggests that from all patients with drug-induced 
      anaphylaxis, probably only a minority are associated with mast cell disease. Most of 
      these cases in the literature are related to general anaesthesia. Thus, for patients 
      with mastocytosis, general anaesthesia appears to be a procedure associated with 
      risk of mast cell degranulation, and special precautions should be considered. 
      SUMMARY: The association between immediate drug hypersensitivity and undetected mast 
      cell diseases appears to be moderate, but nevertheless basal serum tryptase 
      determination and examination for skin signs of mast cell disorders are recommended. 
      An ongoing European multicenter study by the European Network for Drug Allergy will 
      provide more information on this topic.

TI  - ADP-ribosylation of platelet actin by botulinum C2 toxin.
PG  - 155-62
AB  - Botulinum C2 toxin is a microbial toxin which possesses ADP-ribosyltransferase 
      activity. In human platelet cytosol a 43-kDa protein was ADP-ribosylated by 
      botulinum C2 toxin. Labelling of the 43-kDa protein using [32P]NAD as substrate was 
      reduced by unlabelled NAD and nicotinamide. The label was removed by treatment with 
      snake venom phosphodiesterase. Half-maximal and maximal ADP-ribosylation occurred at 
      0.1 microgram/ml and 3 micrograms/ml botulinum C2 toxin, respectively. The Km value 
      of the ADP-ribosylation reaction for NAD was about 1 microM. The peptide map of the 
      ADP-ribosylated 43-kDa protein was almost identical with platelet actin. The 
      ADP-ribosylated 43-kDa substrate protein bound to and was eluted from immobilized 
      DNase I in a manner similar to G-actin. Trypsin treatment of platelet cytosol 
      decreased subsequent ADP-ribosylation of the 43-kDa protein without occurrence of 
      smaller labelled polypeptides. Purified platelet actin was also ADP-ribosylated by 
      botulinum C2 toxin with similar characteristics found with actin in platelet 
      cytosol. Phalloidin decreased the ADP-ribosylation of actin in platelet cytosol and 
      of isolated platelet actin. Half-maximal and maximal, about 90%, reduction of actin 
      ADP-ribosylation was observed at 0.4 microM and 10 microM phalloidin, respectively. 
      ADP-ribosylation of purified actin, induced by botulinum C2I toxin, abolished the 
      formation of the typical microfilament network. The data indicate that platelet 
      G-actin but not F-actin is a substrate of botulinum C2 toxin and that this covalent 
      modification largely affects the functional properties of actin.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ophidian accident is a global public health problem. In Mexico, there 
      is a high incidence of snakebites, which cause medical complications that can leave 
      severe sequelae. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the epidemiological overview of snake venom 
      poisoning in the Baja California (BC) peninsula within the 2003-2018 period. METHOD: 
      A descriptive, retrospective analysis of reported cases was carried out, based on 
      data collection and interpretation. RESULTS: A total of 541 records were obtained, 
      out of which 273 occurred in BC and 268 in Baja California Sur (BCS), with an annual 
      average of 17.06 and 16.75, respectively. The incidence rate for BC was 7.62, while 
      for BCS it was 33.09. The highest annual incidence rate in the state of BC 
      corresponded to southern Ensenada, with a value of 42.3, while in BCS it 
      corresponded to the municipality of Comondú, with a value of 54.04. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Epidemiological analyses allow a better local, state and regional understanding of 
      the problem, in order to develop efficient action protocols to face an ophidian 
      accident, as well as to determine the training requirements of medical personnel and 
      establish a support network for the treatment of cases.

      Regeneration After Snakebite Envenoming.

LID - 609961
AB  - Snakebite envenoming is a global neglected disease with an incidence of up to 2.7 
      million new cases every year. Although antivenoms are so-far the most effective 
      treatment to reverse the acute systemic effects induced by snakebite envenoming, 
      they have a limited therapeutic potential, being unable to completely neutralize the 
      local venom effects. Local damage, such as dermonecrosis and myonecrosis, can lead 
      to permanent sequelae with physical, social, and psychological implications. The 
      strong inflammatory process induced by snake venoms is associated with poor tissue 
      regeneration, in particular the lack of or reduced skeletal muscle regeneration. 
      Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)-based therapies have shown both anti-inflammatory 
      and pro-regenerative properties. We postulate that using allogeneic MSCs or their 
      cell-free products can induce skeletal muscle regeneration in snakebite victims, 
      improving all the three steps of the skeletal muscle regeneration process, mainly by 
      anti-inflammatory activity, paracrine effects, neovascularization induction, and 
      inhibition of tissue damage, instrumental for microenvironment remodeling and 
      regeneration. Since snakebite envenoming occurs mainly in areas with poor 
      healthcare, we enlist the principles and potential of MSCs-based therapies and 
      discuss regulatory issues, good manufacturing practices, transportation, storage, 
      and related-procedures that could allow the administration of these therapies, 
      looking forward to a safe and cost-effective treatment for a so far unsolved and 
      neglected health problem.

AB  - Investigating the pharmacology is key to the modernization of Chinese Medicine (CM) 
      formulas. However, identifying which are the active compound(s) of CM formulas, 
      which biological entities they target, and through which signaling pathway(s) they 
      act to modify disease symptoms, are still difficult tasks for researchers, even when 
      equipped with an arsenal of advanced modern technologies. Multiple approaches, 
      including network pharmacology, pharmaco-genomics, -proteomics, and -metabolomics, 
      have been developed to study the pharmacology of CM formulas. They fall into two 
      general categories in terms of how they tackle a problem: bottom-up and top-down. In 
      this article, we compared these two different approaches in several dimensions by 
      using the case of MaZiRenWan (MZRW, also known as Hemp Seed Pill), a CM herbal 
      formula for functional constipation. Multiple hypotheses are easy to be proposed in 
      the bottom-up approach (e.g. network pharmacology); but these hypotheses are usually 
      false positives and hard to be tested. In contrast, it is hard to suggest hypotheses 
      in the top-down approach (e.g. pharmacometabolomics); however, once a hypothesis is 
      proposed, it is much easier to be tested. Merging of these two approaches could 
      results in a powerful approach, which could be the new paradigm for the 
      pharmacological study of CM formulas.

TI  - Refractory Anaphylaxis: Data From the European Anaphylaxis Registry.
PG  - 2482
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2019.02482 [doi]
LID - 2482
AB  - Refractory anaphylaxis (unresponsive to treatment with at least two doses of minimum 
      300 μg adrenaline) is a rare and often fatal hypersensitivity reaction. 
      Comprehensive data on its definition, prevalence, and risk factors are missing. 
      Using the data from the European Anaphylaxis Registry (11,596 cases in total) we 
      identified refractory anaphylaxis cases (n = 42) and analyzed these in comparison to 
      a control group of severe anaphylaxis cases (n = 4,820). The data show that drugs 
      more frequently elicited refractory anaphylaxis (50% of cases, p < 0.0001) compared 
      to other severe anaphylaxis cases (19.7%). Cases elicited by insects (n = 8) were 
      more often due to bees than wasps in refractory cases (62.5 vs. 19.4%, p = 0.009). 
      The refractory cases occurred mostly in a perioperative setting (45.2 vs. 9.05, p < 
      0.0001). Intramuscular adrenaline (as a first line therapy) was administered in 
      16.7% of refractory cases, whereas in 83.3% of cases it was applied intravenously 
      (significantly more often than in severe anaphylaxis cases: 12.3%, p < 0.0001). 
      Second line treatment options (e.g., vasopression with dopamine, methylene blue, 
      glucagon) were not used at all for the treatment of refractory cases. The mortality 
      rate in refractory anaphylaxis was significantly higher (26.2%) than in severe cases 
      (0.353%, p < 0.0001). Refractory anaphylaxis is associated with drug-induced 
      anaphylaxis in particular if allergens are given intravenously. Although physicians 
      frequently use adrenaline in cases of perioperative anaphylaxis, not all patients 
      are responding to treatment. Whether a delay in recognition of anaphylaxis is 
      responsible for the refractory case or whether these cases are due to an overflow 
      with mast cell activating substances-requires further studies. Reasons for the low 
      use of second-line medication (i.e., methylene blue or dopamine) in refractory cases 
      are unknown, but their use might improve the outcome of severe refractory 
      anaphylaxis cases.

TI  - Thrombin-dependent Incorporation of von Willebrand Factor into a Fibrin Network.
PG  - 35979-86
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M114.591677 [doi]
AB  - Attachment of platelets from the circulation onto a growing thrombus is a process 
      involving multiple platelet receptors, endothelial matrix components, and 
      coagulation factors. It has been indicated previously that during a transglutaminase 
      reaction activated factor XIII (FXIIIa) covalently cross-links von Willebrand factor 
      (VWF) to polymerizing fibrin. Bound VWF further recruits and activates platelets via 
      interactions with the platelet receptor complex glycoprotein Ib (GPIb). In the 
      present study we found proof for binding of VWF to a fibrin monomer layer during the 
      process of fibrinogen-to-fibrin conversion in the presence of thrombin, arvin, or a 
      snake venom from Crotalus atrox. Using a domain deletion mutant we demonstrated the 
      involvement of the C domains of VWF in this binding. Substantial binding of VWF to 
      fibrin monomers persisted in the presence of the FXIIIa inhibitor K9-DON, 
      illustrating that cross-linking via factor XIII is not essential for this phenomenon 
      and suggesting the identification of a second mechanism through which VWF multimers 
      incorporate into a fibrin network. Under high shear conditions, platelets were shown 
      to adhere to fibrin only if VWF had been incorporated. In conclusion, our 
      experiments show that the C domains of VWF and the E domain of fibrin monomers are 
      involved in the incorporation of VWF during the polymerization of fibrin and that 
      this incorporation fosters binding and activation of platelets. Fibrin thus is not 
      an inert end product but partakes in further thrombus growth. Our findings help to 
      elucidate the mechanism of thrombus growth and platelet adhesion under conditions of 
      arterial shear rate.

TI  - Latrophilins: A Neuro-Centric View of an Evolutionary Conserved Adhesion G 
      Protein-Coupled Receptor Subfamily.
PG  - 700

LID - 700
AB  - The adhesion G protein-coupled receptors latrophilins have been in the limelight for 
      more than 20 years since their discovery as calcium-independent receptors for 
      α-latrotoxin, a spider venom toxin with potent activity directed at neurotransmitter 
      release from a variety of synapse types. Latrophilins are highly expressed in the 
      nervous system. Although a substantial amount of studies has been conducted to 
      describe the role of latrophilins in the toxin-mediated action, the recent 
      identification of endogenous ligands for these receptors helped confirm their 
      function as mediators of adhesion events. Here we hypothesize a role for 
      latrophilins in inter-neuronal contacts and the formation of neuronal networks and 
      we review the most recent information on their role in neurons. We explore 
      molecular, cellular and behavioral aspects related to latrophilin adhesion function 
      in mice, zebrafish, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, in 
      physiological and pathophysiological conditions, including autism spectrum, bipolar, 
      attention deficit and hyperactivity and substance use disorders.

AB  - The situation of public laboratories manufacturing antivenoms in Latin America was 
      analyzed, based on the results of a workshop coordinated by the Pan American 
      Foot-and-Mouth Disease Center (PANAFTOSA) of the Pan American Health Organization 
      (PAHO). Nine countries in the region have 12 public laboratories that produce and 
      distribute antivenoms for use against different venomous animals. The situation of 
      each laboratory was discussed, and an analysis was conducted of the current 
      scenario, which is characterized by increasing regulatory requirements that vary in 
      terms of infrastructure and production capacity. The authors identified a need to 
      organize regional cooperation processes to improve the availability of antivenoms, 
      including: research and development projects to improve processes and technologies; 
      studies of the capacity of antivenoms to neutralize different poisons; and technical 
      training programs for professionals and technical personnel. In the current context, 
      in which the World Health Organization has prepared a global strategy for the 
      prevention and control of snakebite envenoming, PANAFTOSA has taken on coordination 
      of this initiative in the Americas. Improving the availability of antivenoms is the 
      priority. As a result of the workshop, the RELAPA network was created, bringing 
      together public laboratories that manufacture antivenoms in Latin America, in order 
      to strengthen these laboratories and increase the availability of, and access to 
      effective and safe antivenoms throughout Latin America.

TI  - Specific Antiproliferative Properties of Proteinaceous Toxin Secretions from the 
      Marine Annelid Eulalia sp. onto Ovarian Cancer Cells.
LID - 10.3390/md19010031 [doi]
LID - 31
AB  - As Yondelis joins the ranks of approved anti-cancer drugs, the benefit from 
      exploring the oceans' biodiversity becomes clear. From marine toxins, relevant 
      bioproducts can be obtained due to their potential to interfere with specific 
      pathways. We explored the cytotoxicity of toxin-bearing secretions of the polychaete 
      Eulalia onto a battery of normal and cancer human cell lines and discovered that the 
      cocktail of proteins is more toxic towards an ovarian cancer cell line (A2780). The 
      secretions' main proteins were identified by proteomics and transcriptomics: 14-3-3 
      protein, Hsp70, Rab3, Arylsulfatase B and serine protease, the latter two being 
      known toxins. This mixture of toxins induces cell-cycle arrest at G2/M phase after 
      3h exposure in A2780 cells and extrinsic programmed cell death. These findings 
      indicate that partial re-activation of the G2/M checkpoint, which is inactivated in 
      many cancer cells, can be partly reversed by the toxic mixture. Protein-protein 
      interaction networks partake in two cytotoxic effects: cell-cycle arrest with a link 
      to RAB3C and RAF1; and lytic activity of arylsulfatases. The discovery of both 
      mechanisms indicates that venomous mixtures may affect proliferating cells in a 
      specific manner, highlighting the cocktails' potential in the fine-tuning of 
      anti-cancer therapeutics targeting cell cycle and protein homeostasis.

TI  - The Mechanisms of Social Immunity Against Fungal Infections in Eusocial Insects.
LID - 10.3390/toxins11050244 [doi]
LID - 244
AB  - Entomopathogenic fungus as well as their toxins is a natural threat surrounding 
      social insect colonies. To defend against them, social insects have evolved a series 
      of unique disease defenses at the colony level, which consists of behavioral and 
      physiological adaptations. These colony-level defenses can reduce the infection and 
      poisoning risk and improve the survival of societal members, and is known as social 
      immunity. In this review, we discuss how social immunity enables the insect colony 
      to avoid, resist and tolerate fungal pathogens. To understand the molecular basis of 
      social immunity, we highlight several genetic elements and biochemical factors that 
      drive the colony-level defense, which needs further verification. We discuss the 
      chemosensory genes in regulating social behaviors, the antifungal secretions such as 
      some insect venoms in external defense and the immune priming in internal defense. 
      To conclude, we show the possible driving force of the fungal toxins for the 
      evolution of social immunity. Throughout the review, we propose several questions 
      involved in social immunity extended from some phenomena that have been reported. We 
      hope our review about social 'host-fungal pathogen' interactions will help us 
      further understand the mechanism of social immunity in eusocial insects.

TI  - Clots of beta-fibrin. Viscoelastic properties, temperature dependence of elasticity, 
      and interaction with fibrinogen-binding tetrapeptides.
PG  - 311-8
AB  - Clots of human beta-fibrin, in which only (or predominantly) the B fibrinopeptide is 
      released, were formed at 14 degrees C by copperhead venom procoagulant enzyme (CVE 
      or venzyme), at pH 8.5, ionic strength 0.45. The shear modulus of elasticity 
      increased slowly and after several days attained a constant value, which was lower 
      than those of alpha-fibrin or alpha beta-fibrin under the same conditions. Before 
      studying the temperature dependence of elasticity, the CVE was then inhibited by 
      introducing phenyl methyl sulfonyl chloride (PMSF) by diffusion. With increasing 
      temperature, the modulus decreased progressively from 5 degrees C to nearly zero at 
      35 degrees and was essentially reversible with temperature change; recovery of 
      elasticity after change from 34.5 degrees to 14 degrees required approximately 2 d 
      but was considerably faster than the initial buildup of elasticity by CVE at 14 
      degrees. Creep and creep recovery measurements on unligated clots showed creep rates 
      and irrecoverable deformation that were similar in magnitude to those of 
      alpha-fibrin clots formed with batroxobin and much larger than those of alpha 
      beta-fibrin clots formed with thrombin, under the same conditions. During creep and 
      creep recovery, the differential modulus or compliance remained constant, showing 
      that there was no permanent structural damage, and if network strands are severed in 
      slow flow, they must rejoin in new configurations. Introduction (by diffusion) of 
      the tetrapeptides Gly-His-Arg-Pro (GHRP) and Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro (GPRP), which resemble 
      the B and A binding sites on the E domain of fibrin respectively, reduced the shear 
      modulus and increased the creep rate of beta-fibrin clots to an extent similar to 
      the effect of GPRP on alpha beta-fibrin, much more than that of GHRP on alpha 
      beta-fibrin, but much less than that of GPRP on a-fibrin. A ligated beta-fibrin clot 
      formed with Factor XIIIa (in which the activating thrombin had been neutralized by 
      hirudin) showed essentially perfect elastic behavior, with no creep and with 
      complete recovery after removal of stress, and was inert to GHRP.

TI  - Targeted deletion of Fgl-2/fibroleukin in the donor modulates immunologic response 
      and acute vascular rejection in cardiac xenografts.
PG  - 248-56
AB  - BACKGROUND: Xenografts ultimately fail as a result of acute vascular rejection 
      (AVR), a process characterized by intravascular thrombosis, fibrin deposition, and 
      endothelial cell activation. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied whether targeted 
      deletion of Fgl-2, an inducible endothelial cell procoagulant, (Fgl-2-/-) in the 
      donor prevents AVR in a mouse-to-rat cardiac xenotransplantation model. By 3 days 
      after transplant, Fgl-2+/+ grafts developed typical features of AVR associated with 
      increased levels of donor Fgl-2 mRNA. Grafts from Fgl-2-/- mice had reduced fibrin 
      deposition but developed cellular rejection. Treatment with a short course of cobra 
      venom factor and maintenance cyclosporine resulted in long-term acceptance of both 
      Fgl-2+/+ and Fgl-2-/- grafts. On withdrawal of cyclosporine, Fgl-2+/+ grafts 
      developed features of AVR; in contrast, Fgl-2-/- grafts again developed acute 
      cellular rejection. Rejecting Fgl-2+/+ hearts stained positively for IgG, IgM, C3, 
      and C5b-9, whereas rejecting Fgl-2-/- hearts had minimal Ig and complement 
      deposition despite xenoantibodies in the serum. Furthermore, serum containing 
      xenoantibodies failed to stain Fgl-2-/- long-term treated hearts but did stain 
      wild-type heart tissues. Treatment of Fgl-2-/- xenografts with mycophenolate mofetil 
      and tacrolimus, a clinically relevant immune suppression protocol, led to long-term 
      graft acceptance. CONCLUSIONS: Deletion of Fgl-2 ameliorates AVR by downregulation 
      of xenoantigens and may facilitate successful clinical heart xenotransplantation.

AB  - The role of metabolism in tumor growth and chemoresistance has received considerable 
      attention, however, the contribution of mitochondrial bioenergetics in migration, 
      invasion, and metastasis is recently being understood. Migrating cancer cells adapt 
      their energy needs to fluctuating changes in the microenvironment, exhibiting high 
      metabolic plasticity. This occurs due to dynamic changes in the contributions of 
      metabolic pathways to promote localized ATP production in lamellipodia and control 
      signaling mediated by mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Recent evidence has 
      shown that metabolic shifts toward a mitochondrial metabolism based on the reductive 
      carboxylation, glutaminolysis, and phosphocreatine-creatine kinase pathways promote 
      resistance to anoikis, migration, and invasion in cancer cells. The PGC1a-driven 
      metabolic adaptations with increased electron transport chain activity and 
      superoxide levels are essential for metastasis in several cancer models. Notably, 
      these metabolic changes can be determined by the composition and density of the 
      extracellular matrix (ECM). ECM stiffness, integrins, and small Rho GTPases promote 
      mitochondrial fragmentation, mitochondrial localization in focal adhesion complexes, 
      and metabolic plasticity, supporting enhanced migration and metastasis. Here, we 
      discuss the role of ECM in regulating mitochondrial metabolism during migration and 
      metastasis, highlighting the therapeutic potential of compounds affecting 
      mitochondrial function and selectively block cancer cell migration.

TI  - Comparison of real world and core laboratory lupus anticoagulant results from the 
      Antiphospholipid Syndrome Alliance for Clinical Trials and International Networking 
      (APS ACTION) clinical database and repository.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Variability remains a challenge in lupus anticoagulant (LA) testing. 
      OBJECTIVE: To validate LA test performance between Antiphospholipid Syndrome 
      Alliance for Clinical Trials and International Networking (APS ACTION) Core 
      laboratories and examine agreement in LA status between Core and local/hospital 
      laboratories contributing patients to this prospective registry. METHODS: Five Core 
      laboratories used the same reagents, analyzer type, protocols, and characterized 
      samples for LA validation. Non-anticoagulated registry samples were retested at the 
      corresponding regional Core laboratories and anticoagulated samples at a single Core 
      laboratory. Categorical agreement and discrepancies in LA status between Core and 
      local/hospital laboratories were analyzed. RESULTS: Clotting times for the 
      reference/characterized plasmas used for normalized ratios were similar between Core 
      laboratories (CV <4%); precision and agreement for LA positive/negative plasma were 
      similar (all CV ≤5%) in the four laboratories that completed both parts of the 
      validation exercise; 418 registry samples underwent LA testing. Agreement for LA 
      positive/negative status between Core and local/hospital laboratories was observed 
      in 87% (115/132) non-anticoagulated and 77% (183/237) anticoagulated samples. 
      However, 28.7% (120/418) of samples showed discordance between the Core and 
      local/hospital laboratories or equivocal LA results. Some of the results of the 
      local/hospital laboratories might have been unreliable in 24.7% (41/166) and 23% 
      (58/252) of the total non-anticoagulated and anticoagulated samples, respectively. 
      Equivocal results by the Core laboratory might have also contributed to discordance. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Laboratories can achieve good agreement in LA performance by use of the 
      same reagents, analyzer type, and protocols. The standardized Core laboratory 
      results underpin accurate interpretation of APS ACTION clinical data.

AB  - Semantic representations are processed along a posterior-to-anterior gradient 
      reflecting a shift from perceptual (e.g., it has eight legs) to conceptual (e.g., 
      venomous spiders are rare) information. One critical region is the anterior temporal 
      lobe (ATL): patients with semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), a 
      clinical syndrome associated with ATL neurodegeneration, manifest a deep loss of 
      semantic knowledge. We test the hypothesis that svPPA patients perform semantic 
      tasks by over-recruiting areas implicated in perceptual processing. We compared MEG 
      recordings of svPPA patients and healthy controls during a categorization task. 
      While behavioral performance did not differ, svPPA patients showed indications of 
      greater activation over bilateral occipital cortices and superior temporal gyrus, 
      and inconsistent engagement of frontal regions. These findings suggest a pervasive 
      reorganization of brain networks in response to ATL neurodegeneration: the loss of 
      this critical hub leads to a dysregulated (semantic) control system, and defective 
      semantic representations are seemingly compensated via enhanced perceptual 
      processing.

AB  - Aging is often associated with a loss of function. We believe aging to be more an 
      adaptation to the various, and often continuous, stressors encountered during life 
      in order to maintain overall functionality of the systems. The maladaptation of a 
      system during aging may increase the susceptibility to diseases. There are basic 
      cellular functions that may influence and/or are influenced by aging. Mitochondrial 
      function is amongst these. Their presence in almost all cell types makes of these 
      valuable targets for interventions to slow down or even reserve signs of aging. In 
      this review, the role of mitochondria and essential physiological regulators of 
      mitochondria and cellular functions, ion channels, will be discussed in the context 
      of human aging. The origins of inflamm-aging, associated with poor clinical 
      outcomes, will be linked to mitochondria and ion channel biology.

AB  - Proteomics is the charming young daughter of classical protein chemistry. It was 
      conceived in 1975, year of invention of the first proteomic technique, the procedure 
      to separate Escherichia coli and mouse tissue proteins in a two-dimensional 
      polyacrylamide gel. Pregnancy, however, lasted for over 10years and deliverance 
      occurred together with sister protein mass spectrometry. Jointly, the two techniques 
      changed protein chemistry moving it from the study of single molecular entities to 
      whole cell extracts and fluids. This review does not propose to report state-of-the 
      art in proteomics in Latin America but rather to describe its development with 
      emphasis on leading Brazil and Cuba as well as discuss proteomic research in these 
      and other countries exposing the history and stories of researchers and selected 
      laboratories that contributed to its establishment and development in the last 
      20years. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This manuscript accounts for the fact that 
      proteomics was present in Latin America since its birth. However, because the 
      political and the economic situation in the region during the eighties and nineties 
      were not favorable for science expansion, its beginning was shy. This changed at the 
      dawn of the 21st century in such a way that a Latin American country, Brazil, became 
      number 10 in manuscripts published in high impact journals as the Journal of 
      Proteomics and Proteomics in 2012/2013. Interestingly, actual prevailing research 
      themes come from centenary protein areas of study - e.g. neglected diseases - that 
      quickly migrated from classical protein chemistry to proteomics, especially human 
      parasites and snake, scorpion and spider venoms. This article is part of a Special 
      Issue entitled: "20years of Proteomics" in memory of Viatliano Pallini" Guest

TI  - Differential sialic acid content in adult and neonatal fibrinogen mediates 
      differences in clot polymerization dynamics.
PG  - 5202-5214
LID - 10.1182/bloodadvances.2021004417 [doi]
AB  - Neonates possess a molecular variant of fibrinogen, known as fetal fibrinogen, 
      characterized by increased sialic acid, a greater negative charge, and decreased 
      activity compared with adults. Despite these differences, adult fibrinogen is used 
      for the treatment of bleeding in neonates, with mixed efficacy. To determine safe 
      and efficacious bleeding protocols for neonates, more information on neonatal fibrin 
      clot formation and the influence of sialic acid on these processes is needed. Here, 
      we examine the influence of sialic acid on neonatal fibrin polymerization. We 
      hypothesized that the increased sialic acid content of neonatal fibrinogen promotes 
      fibrin B:b knob-hole interactions and consequently influences the structure and 
      function of the neonatal fibrin matrix. We explored this hypothesis through analysis 
      of structural properties and knob:hole polymerization dynamics of normal and 
      desialylated neonatal fibrin networks and compared them with those formed with adult 
      fibrinogen. We then characterized normal neonatal fibrin knob:hole interactions by 
      forming neonatal and adult clots with either thrombin or snake-venom thrombin-like 
      enzymes that preferentially cleave fibrinopeptide A or B. Sialic acid content of 
      neonatal fibrinogen was determined to be a key determinant of resulting clot 
      properties. Experiments analyzing knob:hole dynamics indicated that typical neonatal 
      fibrin clots are formed with the release of more fibrinopeptide B and less 
      fibrinopeptide A than adults. After the removal of sialic acid, fibrinopeptide 
      release was roughly equivalent between adults and neonates, indicating the influence 
      of sialic acid on fibrin neonatal fibrin polymerization mechanisms. These results 
      could inform future studies developing neonatal-specific treatments of bleeding.

TI  - Accommodation after lung xenografting from hamster to rat.
PG  - 607-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term xenograft survival can be achieved in hamster hearts 
      transplanted into rats treated with cobra venom factor (CVF) and cyclosporine A 
      (CsA). This phenomenon of "accommodation" is associated with expression of 
      protective genes such as bcl-2, bcl-X(L), and heme-oxygenase-1. We examined whether 
      accommodation could be induced in hamster-to-rat lung xenografts and whether the 
      pattern of protective genes is similar to cardiac xenografts. METHODS: We used 
      hamster-to-rat cardiac and lung xenotransplantation models. Cardiac xenotransplants 
      were treated with CVF+CsA and compared with untreated controls. Lung xenotransplants 
      were treated with either CVF+CsA or FK506 and cyclophosphamide (Cp) and compared 
      with untreated controls. All recipients were killed by 21 days after 
      transplantation. We examined graft survival and protein expression of protective 
      genes, and we performed histologic and immunohistologic analyses. RESULTS: Rejection 
      occurred rapidly in untreated rats. CVF+CsA or FK506+Cp treatment significantly 
      influenced graft survival. Eight of 12 CVF+CsA-treated heart transplants survived 21 
      days. Seven of 16 CVF+CsA-treated lung grafts and five of 12 FK506+Cp-treated lung 
      xenografts survived 21 days. We observed significant protein expression of bcl-2, 
      bcl-X(L), and heme-oxygenase-1 in cardiac xenografts treated with CVF+CsA at 2, 14, 
      and 21 days after transplantation, compared with normal hamster hearts. We also 
      observed significant expression of these proteins in lung xenografts treated with 
      either CVF+CsA or FK506+Cp at 21 days after transplantation, compared with normal 
      lungs. CONCLUSIONS: Accommodation may be a general phenomenon for all organs, 
      mediated through protective genes. Induction of accommodation does not require 
      disruption of the complement system.

AB  - Arenobufagin (ArBu), one of the main active bufadienolides of toad venom with 
      cardiotonic effect, analgesic effect, and outstanding anti-tumor potentiality, is 
      also a potential cardiotoxic component. In the present study, the cardiac effect of 
      ArBu and its underlying mechanism were explored by integrating data such as heart 
      rates, toxicokinetics, myocardial enzyme and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) 
      activity, pathological sections, lipidomics and proteomics. Under different doses, 
      the cardiac effects turned out to be different. The oral dose of 60 mg/kg of ArBu 
      sped up the heart rate. However, 120 mg/kg ArBu mainly reduced the heart rate. Over 
      time, they all returned to normal, consisting of the trend of ArBu 
      concentration-time curve. High concentrations of myocardial enzymes and BNP 
      indicated that ArBu inhibited or impaired the cardiac function of rats. Pathological 
      sections of hearts also showed that ArBu caused myocardial fiber disorder and 
      rupture, in which the high-dose group was more serious. At the same time, serum and 
      heart tissue lipidomics were used to explore the changes in body lipid metabolism 
      under different doses. The data indicated a larger difference in the high-dose ArBu 
      group. There were likewise many significant differences in the proteomics of the 
      heart. Furthermore, a multi-layered network was used to integrate the above 
      information to explore the potential mechanism. Finally, 4 proteins that were shown 
      to be significantly and differentially expressed were validated by targeted 
      proteomics using parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) analysis. Our findings indicated 
      that ArBu behaved as a bidirectional regulation of the heart. The potential 
      mechanism of cardiac action was revealed with the increased dose, which provided a 
      useful reference for the safety of clinical application of ArBu.

AB  - Lysine acetylation (Kac) plays a critical role in the regulation of many important 
      cellular processes. However, little is known about Kac in Solenopsis invicta, which 
      is among the 100 most dangerous invasive species in the world. Kac in S. invicta was 
      evaluated for the first time in this study. Altogether, 2387 Kac sites were tested 
      in 992 proteins. The prediction of subcellular localization indicated that most 
      identified proteins were located in the cytoplasm, mitochondria, and nucleus. Venom 
      allergen Sol i 2, Sol i 3, and Sol i 4 were found to be located in the 
      extracellular. The enriched Kac site motifs included Kac H, Kac Y, Kac G, Kac F, Kac 
      T, and Kac W. H, Y, F, and W frequently occurred at the +1 position, whereas G, Y, 
      and T frequently occurred at the -1 position. In the cellular component, acetylated 
      proteins were enriched in the cytoplasmic part, mitochondrial matrix, and cytosolic 
      ribosome. Furthermore, 25 pathways were detected to have significant enrichment. 
      Interestingly, arginine and proline metabolism, as well as phagosome, which are 
      related to immunity, involved several Kac proteins. Sequence alignment analyses 
      demonstrated that V-type proton ATPase subunit G, tubulin alpha chain, and arginine 
      kinase, the acetylated lysine residues, were evolutionarily conserved among 
      different ant species. In the investigation of the interaction network, diverse 
      interactions were adjusted by Kac. The results indicated that Kac may play an 
      important role in the sensitization, cellular energy metabolism, immune response, 
      nerve signal transduction, and response to biotic and abiotic stress of S. invicta. 
      It may be useful to confirm the functions of Kac target proteins for the design of 
      specific and effective drugs to prevent and control this dangerous invasive species.

TI  - In adrenal glomerulosa cells, angiotensin II inhibits proliferation by interfering 
      with fibronectin-integrin signaling.
PG  - 3435-45

AB  - Angiotensin II (Ang II), through the Ang II type 1 receptor subtype, inhibits basal 
      proliferation of adrenal glomerulosa cells by inducing the disruption of actin 
      stress fiber organization. This effect is observed in cells cultured on plastic or 
      on fibronectin. The aim of the present study was to investigate how Ang II may 
      interfere with extracellular matrix/integrin signaling. In cells treated for 3 d 
      with echistatin (EC) (a snake-venom RGD-containing protein that abolishes 
      fibronectin binding to alpha(5)beta(1) or alpha(v)beta(3) integrins), basal 
      proliferation decreased by 38%, whereas Ang II was unable to abolish basal 
      proliferation. In cells grown on fibronectin, Ang II decreased binding of paxillin 
      to focal adhesions and, similarly to EC, induced a rapid dephosphorylation of 
      paxillin (1 min), followed by an increase after 15 min. Fibronectin enhanced RhoA/B 
      and Rac activation induced by Ang II, an effect abolished by EC. Under basal 
      conditions, paxillin was more readily associated with RhoA/B than with Rac. 
      Stimulation with Ang II induced a transient decrease in RhoA/B-associated paxillin 
      (after 5 min), with a return to basal levels after 10 min, while increasing 
      Rac-associated paxillin. Finally, results reveal that glomerulosa cells are able to 
      synthesize and secrete fibronectin, a process by which cells can stimulate their own 
      proliferative activity when cultured on plastic. Together, these results suggest 
      that Ang II acts at the level of integrin-paxillin complexes to disrupt the well- 
      developed microfilament network, a condition necessary for the inhibition of cell 
      proliferation and initiation of steroidogenesis.

TI  - Transcriptional Profiles of Diploid Mutant Apis mellifera Embryos after Knockout of 
      csd by CRISPR/Cas9.
LID - 10.3390/insects12080704 [doi]
LID - 704
AB  - In honey bees, complementary sex determiner (csd) is the primary signal of sex 
      determination. Its allelic composition is heterozygous in females, and hemizygous or 
      homozygous in males. To explore the transcriptome differences after sex 
      differentiation between males and females, with genetic differences excluded, csd in 
      fertilized embryos was knocked out by CRISPR/Cas9. The diploid mutant males at 24 h, 
      48 h, 72 h, and 96 h after egg laying (AEL) and the mock-treated females derived 
      from the same fertilized queen were investigated through RNA-seq. Mutations were 
      detected in the target sequence in diploid mutants. The diploid mutant drones had 
      typical male morphological characteristics and gonads. Transcriptome analysis showed 
      that several female-biased genes, such as worker-enriched antennal (Wat), 
      vitellogenin (Vg), and some venom-related genes, were down-regulated in the diploid 
      mutant males. In contrast, some male-biased genes, such as takeout and 
      apolipophorin-III-like protein (A4), had higher expressions in the diploid mutant 
      males. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) indicated that there 
      might be interactions between csd and fruitless (fru), feminizer (fem) and hexamerin 
      70c (hex70c), transformer-2 (tra2) and troponin T (TpnT). The information provided 
      by this study will benefit further research on the sex dimorphism and development of 
      honey bees and other insects in Hymenoptera.

TI  - A regional approach to unmet needs in anaphylaxis.
PG  - 88-93
AB  - Allergic diseases are under-diagnosed and undertreated despite their wide 
      prevalence, and particularly anaphylaxis is often under-estimated. Evidence-based 
      anaphylaxis guidelines developed by principal allergy organizations agree on 
      increased prevalence of anaphylaxis, especially in patients younger than 18 years 
      (18-27,30): this trend highlights the need for actions on anaphylaxis management and 
      prevention (3,4). Lack of prompt connection between emergency department and allergy 
      unit after discharge, and of a dedicated ICD-9th identification code (18-26), can 
      delay diagnosis and treatment of anaphylaxis (28,29). Also in the experience of our 
      Allergy Unit, patients reach the allergist office after several attacks treated in 
      ED (17), without a previous evaluation and risk assessment. Keeping in mind unmet 
      needs in anaphylaxis (4), we focused on regional approaches to health care delivery. 
      The key point of our project was to establish an active collaboration between 
      allergist clinicians and their counterparts in emergency medicine, with a system of 
      quick filing report of patients discharged from ED with the suspect of anaphylactic 
      reaction, directed to a central allergy unit, acting in a hub and spoke model with 
      the Ligurian allergy network (31). Aim of the project was to improve epidemiological 
      data collection via direct connection among ED and allergy network; moreover, we 
      tried to provide a quick and proper evaluation of all reported patients, 
      identifying, when possible, the agent responsible for anaphylaxis, to provide 
      instructions on how to minimize future exposure; as all individuals at risk for 
      anaphylaxis should carry and know how to self-administer epinephrine, we managed to 
      provide auto injector and proper training when appropriate. A follow up on 
      readmissions was carried out during the study and four months later. In a 20 months 
      observation period (2013/2014), 205 patients were reported: it was possible to reach 
      a diagnosis and risk assessment in 64.3%. Anaphylaxis diagnosis was considered 
      likely if any 1 of 3 criteria is satisfied within minutes to hours: acute onset of 
      illness with involvement of skin, mucosal surface, or both, and at least 1 of the 
      following: respiratory compromise, hypotension, or end-organ dysfunction; 2 or more 
      of the following occur rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen: involvement of 
      skin or mucosal surface, respiratory compromise, hypotension, or persistent 
      gastrointestinal symptoms; hypotension develops after exposure to a known allergen 
      for that patient: age-specific low blood pressure or decreased systolic blood 
      pressure more than 30% compared with baseline. Of 205 patients reported, 132 were 
      classified as severe anaphylaxis; other 73 cases reported were 12 drugs related 
      angioedema (mostly NSAID related), 9 ACEi related angioedema, 3 ereditary C1inh 
      deficiency angioedema, 24 istaminergic idiopatic angioedema, 14 urticaria 
      angioedema, 6 severe asthma, 2 latex reactions; in three patients a proper diagnosis 
      was not achieved due to refuse / impossibility to perform diagnostic workout. 
      Hymenoptera venom and food proved to be the main triggers, followed by drugs. 100% 
      patients at risk of anaphylaxis received self-injectable adrenaline, pertinent 
      education and individual action plan. In the same period, even though short, there 
      were only two readmissions to ED. First result seems to confirm the usefulness of 
      our approach to address some of unmet needs in anaphylaxis management, as recently 
      pointed out by ICON guidelines (4).

TI  - Nociception-induced spatial and temporal plasticity of synaptic connection and 
      function in the hippocampal formation of rats: a multi-electrode array recording.
PG  - 55

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pain is known to be processed by a complex neural network (neuromatrix) 
      in the brain. It is hypothesized that under pathological state, persistent or 
      chronic pain can affect various higher brain functions through ascending pathways, 
      leading to co-morbidities or mental disability of pain. However, so far the 
      influences of pathological pain on the higher brain functions are less clear and 
      this may hinder the advances in pain therapy. In the current study, we studied 
      spatiotemporal plasticity of synaptic connection and function in the hippocampal 
      formation (HF) in response to persistent nociception. RESULTS: On the hippocampal 
      slices of rats which had suffered from persistent nociception for 2 h by receiving 
      subcutaneous bee venom (BV) or formalin injection into one hand paw, multisite 
      recordings were performed by an 8 x 8 multi-electrode array probe. The waveform of 
      the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP), induced by perforant path 
      electrical stimulation and pharmacologically identified as being activity-dependent 
      and mediated by ionotropic glutamate receptors, was consistently positive-going in 
      the dentate gyrus (DG), while that in the CA1 was negative-going in shape in naïve 
      and saline control groups. For the spatial characteristics of synaptic plasticity, 
      BV- or formalin-induced persistent pain significantly increased the number of 
      detectable fEPSP in both DG and CA1 area, implicating enlargement of the synaptic 
      connection size by the injury or acute inflammation. Moreover, the input-output 
      function of synaptic efficacy was shown to be distinctly enhanced by the injury with 
      the stimulus-response curve being moved leftward compared to the control. For the 
      temporal plasticity, long-term potentiation produced by theta burst stimulation 
      (TBS) conditioning was also remarkably enhanced by pain. Moreover, it is strikingly 
      noted that the shape of fEPSP waveform was drastically deformed or split by a TBS 
      conditioning under the condition of persistent nociception, while that in naïve or 
      saline control state was not affected. All these changes in synaptic connection and 
      function, confirmed by the 2-dimentional current source density imaging, were found 
      to be highly correlated with peripheral persistent nociception since pre-blockade of 
      nociceptive impulses could eliminate all of them. Finally, the initial 
      pharmacological investigation showed that AMPA/KA glutamate receptors might play 
      more important roles in mediation of pain-associated spatiotemporal plasticity than 
      NMDA receptors. CONCLUSION: Peripheral persistent nociception produces great impact 
      upon the higher brain structures that lead to not only temporal plasticity, but also 
      spatial plasticity of synaptic connection and function in the HF. The spatial 
      plasticity of synaptic activities is more complex than the temporal plasticity, 
      comprising of enlargement of synaptic connection size at network level, deformed 
      fEPSP at local circuit level and, increased synaptic efficacy at cellular level. In 
      addition, the multi-synaptic model established in the present investigation may open 
      a new avenue for future studies of pain-related brain dysfunctions at the higher 
      level of the neuromatrix.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Myotoxicity is a recognised but poorly characterised effect of snake 
      envenoming worldwide. We aimed to describe the clinical effects, complications and 
      effectiveness of antivenom in myotoxicity from Australian snake envenoming. METHODS: 
      Patients were recruited to the Australian Snakebite Project (ASP), a prospective, 
      observational study of patients with suspected or proven snakebite countrywide. 
      After informed consent data is collected and stored in a dedicated database and 
      blood samples are taken and stored. We included patients with envenoming and 
      biochemical evidence of myotoxicity (peak creatine kinase [CK] > 1000 U/L). Snake 
      species was determined by expert identification or venom specific enzyme 
      immunoassay. Analysis included patient demographics, clinical findings, pathology 
      results, treatment and outcomes (length of hospital stay, complications). RESULTS: 
      1638 patients were recruited January 2003-December 2016, 935 (57%) were envenomed, 
      148 developed myotoxicity (16%). Snake species most commonly associated with 
      myotoxicity were Notechis spp. (30%), Pseudechis porphyriacus (20%) and Pseudechis 
      australis (13%). Bite site effects occurred in 19 patients. Non-specific systemic 
      symptoms occurred in 135 patients (91%), specific signs and symptoms in 83. In 120 
      patients with early serial CK results, the median peak CK was 3323 U/L 
      (IQR;1050-785100U/L), the median time to first CK >500 U/L was 11.1 h and median 
      time to peak CK of 34.3 h. White cell count was elevated in 136 patients (93%; 
      median time to elevation, 4.9 h). 37 patients had elevated creatinine, six were 
      dialysed. Two patients died from complications of severe myotoxicity. Antivenom 
      given before the first abnormal CK (>500 U/L) was associated with less severe 
      myotoxicity (2976 versus 7590 U/L). Non-envenomed patients with elevated CK had 
      rapid rise to abnormal CK (median 3.5 h) and less had elevated WCC (32%). 
      CONCLUSION: Myotoxicity from Australian snakes is relatively common and has systemic 
      effects, with significant associated morbidity and mortality. CK is not a good early 
      biomarker of mytoxicity. Early antivenom may play a role in reducing severity.

TI  - Structural basis of strict substrate recognition of l-lysine α-oxidase from 
      Trichoderma viride.
PG  - 2213-2225
LID - 10.1002/pro.3946 [doi]
AB  - l-Lysine oxidase (LysOX) is a FAD-dependent homodimeric enzyme that catalyzes the 
      oxidative deamination of l-lysine to produce α-keto-ε-aminocaproate with ammonia and 
      hydrogen peroxide. LysOX shows strict substrate specificity for l-lysine, whereas 
      most l-amino acid oxidases (LAAOs) exhibit broad substrate specificity for l-amino 
      acids. Previous studies of LysOX showed that overall structural similarity to the 
      well-studied snake venom LAAOs. However, the molecular mechanism of strict 
      specificity for l-lysine was still unclear. We here determined the structure of 
      LysOX in complex with l-lysine at 1.7 Å resolution. The structure revealed that the 
      hydrogen bonding network formed by D212, D315, and A440 with two water molecules is 
      responsible for the recognition of the side chain amino group. In addition, a narrow 
      hole formed by five hydrophobic residues in the active site contributes to strict 
      substrate specificity. Mutation studies demonstrated that D212 and D315 are 
      essential for l-lysine recognition, and the D212A/D315A double mutant LysOX showed 
      different substrate specificity from LysOX. Moreover, the structural basis of the 
      substrate specificity change has also been revealed by the structural analysis of 
      the mutant variant and its substrate complexes. These results clearly explain the 
      molecular mechanism of the strict specificity of LysOX and suggest that LysOX is a 
      potential candidate for a template to design LAAOs specific to other l-amino acids.

AB  - Whereas interspecific associations receive considerable attention in evolutionary, 
      behavioural and ecological literature, the proximate bases for these associations 
      are usually unknown. This in particular applies to associations between vertebrates 
      with invertebrates. The West-African savanna frog Phrynomantis microps lives in the 
      underground nest of ponerine ants (Paltothyreus tarsatus). The ants usually react 
      highly aggressively when disturbed by fiercely stinging, but the frog is not 
      attacked and lives unharmed among the ants. Herein we examined the proximate 
      mechanisms for this unusual association. Experiments with termites and mealworms 
      covered with the skin secretion of the frog revealed that specific chemical 
      compounds seem to prevent the ants from stinging. By HPLC-fractionation of an 
      aqueous solution of the frogs' skin secretion, two peptides of 1,029 and 1,143 Da 
      were isolated and found to inhibit the aggressive behaviour of the ants. By de novo 
      sequencing using tandem mass spectrometry, the amino acid sequence of both peptides 
      consisting of a chain of 9 and 11 residues, respectively, was elucidated. Both 
      peptides were synthesized and tested, and exhibited the same inhibitory properties 
      as the original frog secretions. These novel peptides most likely act as an 
      appeasement allomone and may serve as models for taming insect aggression.

TI  - Interventions for Post-Stroke Shoulder Pain: An Overview of Systematic Reviews.
PG  - 1411-1426
LID - 10.2147/IJGM.S200929 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Shoulder pain following stroke leads to poorer quality of life and daily 
      functioning. Whilst many treatment approaches exist, there is currently no 
      systematic overview of the evidence base for these. This review addressed the 
      question "What is the evidence for interventions for treating hemiplegic shoulder 
      pain?" METHODS: An overview of systematic reviews was performed according to 
      PROSPERO protocol (CRD42020140521). Five electronic databases including Cochrane, 
      MEDLINE, Embase and EmCare were searched to June 2019. Included systematic reviews 
      were those of comparative trials of interventions for hemiplegic shoulder pain in 
      adults, reporting pain outcomes using a validated pain scale. Review quality was 
      assessed with AMSTAR2 and those considered at high risk of bias for four or more 
      items were excluded. The most recent, comprehensive review for each intervention 
      category was included. Outcomes of function and quality of life were also extracted. 
      RESULTS: Seven systematic reviews of 11 interventions were included, with varied 
      quality. Reviews showed significant benefits in terms of pain reduction for many 
      interventions including acupuncture (conventional 19 trials, electroacupuncture 5 
      trials, fire needle 2 trials, warm needle 1 trial and bee venom 3 trials), orthoses 
      (1 trial), botulinum toxin injection (4 trials), electrical stimulation (6 trials) 
      and aromatherapy (1 trial). However, the majority of trials were small, leading to 
      imprecise estimates of effect. Findings were often inconsistent across outcome 
      measures or follow-up times. Outcomes from trials of acupuncture were heterogenous 
      with likely publication bias. CONCLUSION: A number of systematic reviews indicate 
      significant reductions in pain, with a wide range of treatments appearing promising. 
      However, significant limitations mean the clinical importance of these findings are 
      uncertain. Due to complex etiology, practitioners and health systems must consider 
      the range of potential interventions and tailor their approach to individual 
      presentation, guided by their local circumstances, expert opinion and the growing 
      literature base.

TI  - The CCL3 family of chemokines and innate immunity cooperate in vivo in the 
      eradication of an established lymphoma xenograft by rituximab.
PG  - 6616-23
AB  - The therapeutic mAb rituximab induced the expression of the CCL3 and CCL4 chemokines 
      in the human lymphoma line BJAB following binding to the CD20 Ag. Induction of 
      CCL3/4 in vitro was specific, was observed in several cell lines and freshly 
      isolated lymphoma samples and also took place at the protein level in vitro and in 
      vivo. To investigate the role of these beta-chemokines in the mechanism of action of 
      rituximab, we synthesized a N-terminally truncated CCL3 molecule CCL3(11-70), which 
      had antagonist activity on chemotaxis mediated by either CCL3 or BJAB supernatant. 
      We also set up an established s.c. BJAB tumor model in athymic mice. Rituximab, 
      given weekly after tumors had reached 250 mm2, led to complete disappearance of the 
      lymphoma within 2-3 wk. Treatment of mice with cobra venom factor showed that 
      complement was required for rituximab therapeutic activity. Treatment of BJAB tumor 
      bearing mice every 2 days with the CCL3(11-70) antagonist, starting 1 wk before 
      rituximab treatment, had no effect on tumor growth by itself, but completely 
      inhibited the therapeutic activity of the Ab. To determine whether CCL3 acts through 
      recruitment/activation of immune cells, we specifically depleted NK cells, 
      polymorphonuclear cells, and macrophages using mAbs, clodronate treatment, or 
      Rag2-/-cgamma-/- mice. The data demonstrated that these different cell populations 
      are involved in BJAB tumor eradication. We propose that rituximab rapidly activates 
      complement and induces beta-chemokines in vivo, which in turn activate the innate 
      immunity network required for efficient eradication of the bulky BJAB tumor.

AB  - Systemic mastocytosis (SM) and other adult clonal mast cell disorders (CMD) are 
      often underestimated, and their epidemiology data are scarce. We aimed at evaluating 
      the impact of the activity of the Interdisciplinary Group for Study of Mastocytosis 
      (GISM) of Verona on the prevalence and incidence of CMD. We examined the data of 502 
      adult patients diagnosed with CMD and residing in the Veneto Region, consecutively 
      referred to GISM between 2006 and 2020. SM was diagnosed in 431 cases, while 71 
      patients had cutaneous mastocytosis or other CMD. Indolent SM represented the most 
      frequent SM variant (91.0%), mainly with the characteristics of bone marrow 
      mastocytosis (54.8%). The prevalence of SM in the adult population of the Veneto 
      region and of the Verona province was 10.2 and 17.2/100,000 inhabitants, 
      respectively. The mean incidence of new SM cases in Verona was 1.09/100,000 
      inhabitants/year. Hymenoptera venom allergy was the main reason (50%) leading to the 
      CMD diagnosis. Osteoporosis, often complicated by fragility fractures, was present 
      in 35% of cases, even in young patients, especially males. Our data show a higher 
      prevalence and incidence of SM than previously reported, confirming that reference 
      centers with multidisciplinary approach are essential for the recognition and early 
      diagnosis of CMD.

TI  - The Structural Basis for a Transition State That Regulates Pore Formation in a 
      Bacterial Toxin.
LID - 10.1128/mBio.00538-19 [doi]
LID - e00538-19
AB  - The cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC) genes are present in bacterial species 
      that span terrestrial, vertebrate, and invertebrate niches, which suggests that they 
      have evolved to function under widely different environmental conditions. Using a 
      combination of biophysical and crystallographic approaches, we reveal that the 
      relative stability of an intramolecular interface in the archetype CDC 
      perfringolysin O (PFO) plays a central role in regulating its pore-forming 
      properties. The disruption of this interface allows the formation of the membrane 
      spanning β-barrel pore in all CDCs. We show here that the relative strength of the 
      stabilizing forces at this interface directly impacts the energy barrier posed by 
      the transition state for pore formation, as reflected in the Arrhenius activation 
      energy (E(a)) for pore formation. This change directly impacts the kinetics and 
      temperature dependence of pore formation. We further show that the interface 
      structure in a CDC from a terrestrial species enables it to function efficiently 
      across a wide range of temperatures by minimizing changes in the strength of the 
      transition state barrier to pore formation. These studies establish a paradigm that 
      CDCs, and possibly other β-barrel pore-forming proteins/toxins, can evolve 
      significantly different pore-forming properties by altering the stability of this 
      transitional interface, which impacts the kinetic parameters and temperature 
      dependence of pore formation.IMPORTANCE The cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) 
      are the archetype for the superfamily of oligomeric pore-forming proteins that 
      includes the membrane attack complex/perforin (MACPF) family of immune defense 
      proteins and the stonefish venom toxins (SNTX). The CDC/MACPF/SNTX family exhibits a 
      common protein fold, which forms a membrane-spanning β-barrel pore. We show that 
      changing the relative stability of an extensive intramolecular interface within this 
      fold, which is necessarily disrupted to form the large β-barrel pore, dramatically 
      alters the kinetic and temperature-dependent properties of CDC pore formation. These 
      studies show that the CDCs and other members of the CDC/MACPF/SNTX superfamily have 
      the capacity to significantly alter their pore-forming properties to function under 
      widely different environmental conditions encountered by these species.

AB  - Biology has evolved a variety of agents capable of permeabilizing and disrupting 
      lipid membranes, from amyloid aggregates, to antimicrobial peptides, to venom 
      compounds. While often associated with disease or toxicity, these agents are also 
      central to many biosensing and therapeutic technologies. Here, we introduce a class 
      of synthetic, DNA-based particles capable of disrupting lipid membranes. The 
      particles have finely programmable size, and self-assemble from all-DNA and 
      cholesterol-DNA nanostructures, the latter forming a membrane-adhesive core and the 
      former a protective hydrophilic corona. We show that the corona can be selectively 
      displaced with a molecular cue, exposing the 'sticky' core. Unprotected particles 
      adhere to synthetic lipid vesicles, which in turn enhances membrane permeability and 
      leads to vesicle collapse. Furthermore, particle-particle coalescence leads to the 
      formation of gel-like DNA aggregates that envelop surviving vesicles. This response 
      is reminiscent of pathogen immobilisation through immune cells secretion of DNA 
      networks, as we demonstrate by trapping E. coli bacteria.

TI  - Quantitative Proteomics Comparison of Total Expressed Proteomes of Anisakis simplex 
      Sensu Stricto, A. pegreffii, and Their Hybrid Genotype.

LID - 913
AB  - The total proteomes of Anisakis simplex s.s., A. pegreffii and their hybrid genotype 
      have been compared by quantitative proteomics (iTRAQ approach), which considers the 
      level of expressed proteins. Comparison was made by means of two independent 
      experiments considering four biological replicates of A. simplex and two each for A. 
      pegreffii and hybrid between both species. A total of 1811 and 1976 proteins have 
      been respectively identified in the experiments using public databases. One hundred 
      ninety-six proteins were found significantly differentially expressed, and their 
      relationships with the nematodes' biological replicates were estimated by a 
      multidimensional statistical approach. Results of pairwise Log(2) ratio comparisons 
      among them were statistically treated and supported in order to convert them into 
      discrete character states. Principal component analysis (PCA) confirms the validity 
      of the method. This comparison selected thirty seven proteins as discriminant 
      taxonomic biomarkers among A. simplex, A. pegreffii and their hybrid genotype; 19 of 
      these biomarkers, encoded by ten loci, are specific allergens of Anisakis (Ani s7, 
      Ani s8, Ani s12, and Ani s14) and other (Ancylostoma secreted) is a common nematodes 
      venom allergen. The rest of the markers comprise four unknown or non-characterized 
      proteins; five different proteins (leucine) related to innate immunity, four 
      proteolytic proteins (metalloendopeptidases), a lipase, a mitochondrial translocase 
      protein, a neurotransmitter, a thyroxine transporter, and a structural collagen 
      protein. The proposed methodology (proteomics and statistical) solidly characterize 
      a set of proteins that are susceptible to take advantage of the new targeted 
      proteomics.

      found many differentially abundant proteins in the serum of AKI group compared with 
      that of the non-AKI and control groups, involved in several metabolic pathways and 
      the regulation of cellular processes. In addition, we also detected differentially 
      abundant metabolites in the AKI group; among them many were involved in the 
      glycerophospholipid metabolic pathway (the key pathway in the context of AKI): 50 
      metabolites, all downregulated in the AKI group. Importantly, the convergent 
      analysis of metabolomics and proteomics data revealed that biomarkers of 
      rhabdomyolysis (CA 3, MYL3, and LDH) and hemolysis (ALT and LDH) were integrated 
      into a regulatory network with phospholipid metabolism products in the AKI group, 
      indicating that wasp sting-induced AKI is secondary to rhabdomyolysis and 
      intravascular hemolysis. Of note, such a phenotype suggests the disruption of the 
      membrane of skeletal muscle cells and red blood cells mediated by the phospholipase 
      A1 (PLA1), PLA2, and mastoparan in the wasp venom, via the disruption of membrane 
      glycerophospholipids. Overall, our results highlight a potential new mechanism 
      behind wasp sting-induced AKI and suggest that PLA inhibitors may be potential 
      agents for the treatment of this condition.

AB  - Anaphylaxis is the most severe clinical presentation of acute systemic allergic 
      reactions. The occurrence of anaphylaxis has increased in recent years, and 
      subsequently, there is a need to continue disseminating knowledge on the diagnosis 
      and management, so every healthcare professional is prepared to deal with such 
      emergencies. The rationale of this updated position document is the need to keep 
      guidance aligned with the current state of the art of knowledge in anaphylaxis 
      management. The World Allergy Organization (WAO) anaphylaxis guidelines were 
      published in 2011, and the current guidance adopts their major indications, 
      incorporating some novel changes. Intramuscular epinephrine (adrenaline) continues 
      to be the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis. Nevertheless, its use remains 
      suboptimal. After an anaphylaxis occurrence, patients should be referred to a 
      specialist to assess the potential cause and to be educated on prevention of 
      recurrences and self-management. The limited availability of epinephrine 
      auto-injectors remains a major problem in many countries, as well as their 
      affordability for some patients.

TI  - The urgent need for a harmonized severity scoring system for acute allergic 
      reactions.
PG  - 1792-1800
LID - 10.1111/all.13408 [doi]
AB  - The accurate assessment and communication of the severity of acute allergic 
      reactions are important to patients, clinicians, researchers, the food industry, and 
      public health and regulatory authorities. Severity has different meanings to 
      different stakeholders with patients and clinicians rating the significance of 
      particular symptoms very differently. Many severity scoring systems have been 
      generated, most focusing on the severity of reactions following exposure to a 
      limited group of allergens. They are heterogeneous in format, none has used an 
      accepted developmental approach, and none has been validated. Their wide range of 
      outcome formats has led to difficulties with interpretation and application. 
      Therefore, there is a persisting need for an appropriately developed and validated 
      severity scoring system for allergic reactions that work across the range of 
      allergenic triggers and address the needs of different stakeholder groups. We 
      propose a novel approach to develop and then validate a harmonized scoring system 
      for acute allergic reactions, based on a data-driven method that is informed by 
      clinical and patient experience and other stakeholders' perspectives. We envisage 
      two formats: (i) a numerical score giving a continuum from mild to severe reactions 
      that are clinically meaningful and are useful for allergy healthcare professionals 
      and researchers, and (ii) a three-grade-based ordinal format that is simple enough 
      to be used and understood by other professionals and patients. Testing of 
      reliability and validity of the new approach in a range of settings and populations 
      will allow eventual implementation of a standardized scoring system in clinical 
      studies and routine practice.

TI  - Peptide Inhibitors of Kv1.5: An Option for the Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation.
LID - 10.3390/ph14121303 [doi]
LID - 1303
AB  - The human voltage gated potassium channel Kv1.5 that conducts the I(Kur) current is 
      a key determinant of the atrial action potential. Its mutations have been linked to 
      hereditary forms of atrial fibrillation (AF), and the channel is an attractive 
      target for the management of AF. The development of I(Kur) blockers to treat AF 
      resulted in small molecule Kv1.5 inhibitors. The selectivity of the blocker for the 
      target channel plays an important role in the potential therapeutic application of 
      the drug candidate: the higher the selectivity, the lower the risk of side effects. 
      In this respect, small molecule inhibitors of Kv1.5 are compromised due to their 
      limited selectivity. A wide range of peptide toxins from venomous animals are 
      targeting ion channels, including mammalian channels. These peptides usually have a 
      much larger interacting surface with the ion channel compared to small molecule 
      inhibitors and thus, generally confer higher selectivity to the peptide blockers. We 
      found two peptides in the literature, which inhibited I(Kur): Ts6 and Osu1. Their 
      affinity and selectivity for Kv1.5 can be improved by rational drug design in which 
      their amino acid sequences could be modified in a targeted way guided by in silico 
      docking experiments.

TI  - FRI-1 Is an Anti-Cancer Isoquinolinequinone That Inhibits the Mitochondrial 
      Bioenergetics and Blocks Metabolic Shifts by Redox Disruption in Breast Cancer 
      Cells.

AB  - Since breast cancer (BC) cells are dependent on mitochondrial bioenergetics for 
      promoting proliferation, survival, and metastasis, mitochondria highlight as an 
      important target for anticancer drug discovery. FRI-1, methyl 1, 3-dimethyl-5, 
      8-dioxo-5, 8-dihydro-4-isoquinolinecarboxylate, was previously described as a 
      selective cytotoxic compound on cancer cell lines, however, details on the mechanism 
      of action remain unknown. In this work, we describe that FRI-1 inhibits 
      mitochondrial bioenergetics, producing apoptosis in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 BC cell 
      lines. FRI-1 decreases the maximal oxygen consumption rate (OCR), Δψm, NADH, and ATP 
      levels, with a notable increase of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
      production, promoting AMPK activation with pro-survival effects. Moreover, FRI-1 
      inhibits the metabolic remodeling to glycolysis induced by oligomycin. In isolated 
      tumoral mitochondria, FRI-1 increases Complex I and III-dependent OCR state 2, and 
      this is sensitive to rotenone and antimycin A inhibitor additions, suggesting a 
      redox cycling event. Remarkably, α-ketoglutarate and lipoic acid supplementation 
      reversed and promoted, respectively, the FRI-1-induced apoptosis, suggesting that 
      mitochondrial redox disruption affects 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH) activity, 
      and this is involved in their anticancer mechanism. Consistent with this, the 
      combination of FRI-1 and CPI-613, a dual inhibitor of redox-sensible tricarboxylic 
      acid (TCA) cycle enzymes PDH and OGDH, produced extensive BC cell death. Taken 
      together, our results suggest that FRI-1 exhibits anticancer effects through 
      inhibition of mitochondrial bioenergetics by redox disruption in BC cells.

TI  - Broad-spectrum antiviral agents: secreted phospholipase A(2) targets viral envelope 
      lipid bilayers derived from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.

AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV), dengue virus (DENV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) 
      belong to the family Flaviviridae. Their viral particles have the envelope composed 
      of viral proteins and a lipid bilayer acquired from budding through the endoplasmic 
      reticulum (ER). The phospholipid content of the ER membrane differs from that of the 
      plasma membrane (PM). The phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) superfamily consists of a 
      large number of members that specifically catalyse the hydrolysis of phospholipids 
      at a particular position. Here we show that the CM-II isoform of secreted PLA(2) 
      obtained from Naja mossambica mossambica snake venom (CM-II-sPLA(2)) possesses 
      potent virucidal (neutralising) activity against HCV, DENV and JEV, with 50% 
      inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) of 0.036, 0.31 and 1.34 ng/ml, respectively. In 
      contrast, the IC(50) values of CM-II-sPLA(2) against viruses that bud through the PM 
      (Sindbis virus, influenza virus and Sendai virus) or trans-Golgi network (TGN) 
      (herpes simplex virus) were >10,000 ng/ml. Moreover, the 50% cytotoxic (CC(50)) and 
      haemolytic (HC(50)) concentrations of CM-II-sPLA(2) were >10,000 ng/ml, implying 
      that CM-II-sPLA(2) did not significantly damage the PM. These results suggest that 
      CM-II-sPLA(2) and its derivatives are good candidates for the development of 
      broad-spectrum antiviral drugs that target viral envelope lipid bilayers derived 
      from the ER membrane.

TI  - Bufalin suppresses the migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells through 
      HOTAIR, the sponge of miR-520b.
PG  - 1228-1236
LID - 10.1038/s41401-019-0234-8 [doi]
AB  - Bufalin, the major active component of the traditional Chinese medicine ChanSu 
      obtained from the skin and parotid venom glands of toads, has long been known as an 
      anticancer agent. Recent studies show that microRNAs (miRs) are involved in the 
      anticancer activities of bufalin, while long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are known to 
      interact with miRNAs to regulate various biological functions. In this paper, we 
      investigated the possible network related to the antimetastatic effect of bufalin in 
      prostate cancer (PCa) cells. We demonstrated that bufalin (0.05-10 µM) 
      dose-dependently suppressed the proliferation of prostate cancer DU145 and PC3 cells 
      with IC(50) values of 0.89 and 1.28 µM, respectively. Furthermore, bufalin treatment 
      significantly suppressed the cell migration and invasion. To explore the role of 
      lncRNAs in the antimetastatic activity of bufalin, we used an lncRNA microarray and 
      found that HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) was the most markedly downregulated 
      lncRNA in bufalin-treated PCa cells. Overexpression of HOTAIR counteracted the 
      suppressing effects of bufalin on DU145 and PC3 cells. We then predicted and 
      verified that HOTAIR upregulated FGFR1 expression by sponging miR-520b in PCa cells. 
      In 40 patients with PCa bone metastasis, we used in situ hybridization or 
      immunohistochemical assay to assess the HOTAIR and FGFR1 expression, which revealed 
      that both HOTAIR and FGFR1 expression were significantly higher in bone metastasis 
      tissues than in the primary PCa tissues. In addition, the level of serum HOTAIR was 
      positively associated with the levels of serum bone metabolic markers (CTx, OST, 
      B-ALP and PINP) and may serve as a reasonable biomarker for PCa bone metastasis. 
      Taken together, this is the first study revealing that HOTAIR promotes PCa bone 
      metastasis, and bufalin may be a promising candidate for the treatment of this 
      disease.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The basophil activation test (BAT) using flow cytometry has 
      supplanted traditional methods of measuring basophil degranulation using histamine 
      and other mediator release, and can be used for clinical applications as well as to 
      explore the immune mechanisms of effector cell response to allergen. This review 
      discusses the advancements made in clinical, diagnostic and laboratory research of 
      allergy utilizing an ever-evolving BAT. RECENT FINDINGS: Being an in vitro surrogate 
      of the allergic reaction that happens in vivo in the sick patient, the BAT can be 
      used to support the diagnosis of various allergic conditions, such as food, drug, 
      respiratory and insect venom allergies, and the assessment of clinical response to 
      allergen-specific immunotherapy and other immunomodulatory treatments. The BAT can 
      also be used for research purposes to explore the mechanisms of allergy and 
      tolerance at the level of the basophil, for instance by manipulating IgE and IgG and 
      their receptors and by studying intracellular signalling cascade in response to 
      allergen. This review covers the applications of the BAT to the clinical management 
      of allergic patients and the increased understanding of the mechanisms of immune 
      response to allergens as well as technological advancements made in recent years.

TI  - Wheat Anaphylaxis in Adults Differs from Reactions to Other Types of Food.
PG  - 2844-2852.e5
LID - S2213-2198(21)00382-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jaip.2021.03.037 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Wheat is one of the most commonly consumed foods and a known elicitor of 
      anaphylaxis in children and adults. Reactions in adults are often cofactor dependent 
      and characterized by a prolonged time between food intake and the onset of symptoms 
      making the diagnosis of wheat anaphylaxis challenging. OBJECTIVE: To characterize a 
      cohort of patients with the history of wheat anaphylaxis to better understand this 
      atypical phenotype of anaphylaxis. METHODS: Data from the European Anaphylaxis 
      Registry from 2007 to 2019 (n = 10,636) including 250 patients (213 adults and 37 
      children) with a history of anaphylaxis caused by wheat were analyzed. RESULTS: 
      Wheat was the most common food elicitor of anaphylaxis in adults in the registry in 
      Central Europe. Reactions to wheat in adults were frequently associated with 
      exercise as a cofactor (82.8%) and partially delayed (57.5%). Only 36.9% of patients 
      had atopic comorbidities, which was uncommonly low for adult patients allergic to 
      other kinds of foods (63.2%). Anaphylaxis to wheat presented frequently with 
      cardiovascular symptoms (86.7%) including severe symptoms such as loss of 
      consciousness (41%) and less often with respiratory symptoms (53.6%). The reactions 
      to wheat were more severe than reactions to other foods (odds ratio [OR] = 4.33), 
      venom (OR = 1.58), or drugs (OR = 2.11). CONCLUSIONS: Wheat is a relevant elicitor 
      of anaphylaxis in adults in Central Europe. Wheat anaphylaxis is highly dependent on 
      the presence of cofactors and less frequently associated with atopic diseases 
      compared with other food allergies. More data on mechanisms of wheat-induced 
      anaphylaxis are required to develop preventive measures for this potentially 
      life-threatening disease.

TI  - cAMP- and cGMP-elevating agents inhibit GPIbα-mediated aggregation but not

AB  - BACKGROUND: The glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V complex is a unique platelet plasma 
      membrane receptor, which is essential for platelet adhesion and thrombus formation. 
      GPIbα, part of the GPIb-IX-V complex, has several physiological ligands such as von 
      Willebrand factor (vWF), thrombospondin and distinct coagulation factors, which 
      trigger platelet activation. Despite having an important role, intracellular 
      GPIb-IX-V signaling and its regulation by other pathways are not well defined. Our 
      aim was to establish the intracellular signaling response of selective GPIbα 
      activation in human platelets, in particular the role of the tyrosine kinase Syk and 
      its regulation by cAMP/PKA and cGMP/PKG pathways, respectively. We addressed this 
      using echicetin beads (EB), which selectively bind to GPIbα and induce platelet 
      aggregation. METHODS: Purified echicetin from snake Echis carinatus venom was 
      validated by mass spectrometry. Washed human platelets were incubated with EB, in 
      the presence or absence of echicetin monomers (EM), Src family kinase (SFK) 
      inhibitors, Syk inhibitors and the cAMP- and cGMP-elevating agents iloprost and 
      riociguat, respectively. Platelet aggregation was analyzed by light transmission 
      aggregometry, protein phosphorylation by immunoblotting. Intracellular messengers 
      inositolmonophosphate (InsP1) and Ca(2+)(i) were measured by ELISA and 
      Fluo-3 AM/FACS, respectively. RESULTS: EB-induced platelet aggregation was dependent 
      on integrin α(IIb)β(3) and secondary mediators ADP and TxA(2), and was antagonized 
      by EM. EB stimulated Syk tyrosine phosphorylation at Y352, which was SFK-dependent 
      and Syk-independent, whereas Y525/526 phosphorylation was SFK-dependent and 
      partially Syk-dependent. Furthermore, phosphorylation of both Syk Y352 and Y525/526 
      was completely integrin α(IIb)β(3)-independent but, in the case of Y525/526, was 
      partially ADP/TxA(2)-dependent. Syk activation, observed as Y352/ Y525/Y526 
      phosphorylation, led to the phosphorylation of direct substrates (LAT Y191, PLCγ2 
      Y759) and additional targets (Akt S473). PKA/PKG pathways inhibited EB-induced 
      platelet aggregation and Akt phosphorylation but, surprisingly, enhanced Syk and 
      LAT/PLCγ2 tyrosine phosphorylation. A similar PKA/PKG effect was confirmed with 
      convulxin-/GPVI-stimulated platelets. EB-induced InsP1 accumulation/InsP3 production 
      and Ca(2+)-release were Syk-dependent, but only partially inhibited by PKA/PKG 
      pathways. CONCLUSION: EB and EM are specific agonists and antagonists, respectively, 
      of GPIbα-mediated Syk activation leading to platelet aggregation. The cAMP/PKA and 
      cGMP/PKG pathways do not inhibit but enhance GPIbα-/GPVI-initiated, SFK-dependent 
      Syk activation, but strongly inhibit further downstream responses including 
      aggregation. These data establish an important intracellular regulatory network 
      induced by GPIbα.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of nerve growth factor (NGF) from 
      cobra venom and human transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) on the chondrogenic 
      induction of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). NGF and TGF-β1 were used to induce 
      chondrogenesis of MSCs from rabbits for 7 days. Total RNA was extracted for mRNA 
      sequencing. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs), gene ontology (GO), KEGG pathway 
      enrichment, and PPI network analysis were conducted to screen the specific 
      signalling pathways and target genes. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain 
      reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to further confirm the relative target genes. The 
      results showed that NGF could significantly promote the expression of hyaline 
      cartilage specific genes (collagen type II alpha 1 chain, COL2A1) compared with 
      TGF-β1. PI3K-AKT signalling pathway is commonly involved in the chondrogenesis of 
      MSCs induced by NGF and TGF-β1. However, the expression levels of the genes in the 
      PI3K-AKT signalling pathway were significantly higher in NGF group than that in the 
      TGF-β1 group. In the process of chondrogenesis of MSCs induced by NGF and TGF-β1, 
      integrin (ITGAs) were the targeted hub genes to activate the PI3K-AKT signalling 
      pathway. NGF could activate more proliferation and differentiation genes in the 
      process of chondrogenesis of MSCs than TGF-β1. TGF-β1 promoted angiogenesis by 
      targeting the thrombospondin (THBS1) and THBS2 which might contribute to the 
      osteophyte formation. PI3K-AKT was the crucial signalling pathway for chondrogenic 
      differentiation. NGF could activate the PI3K-AKT signalling pathway to a higher 
      level, and NGF had more specificity for promoting expression of specific genes of 
      chondrocyte compared with TGF-β1. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: In our study, we 
      compared two different growth factors in promoting cartilage differentiation of MSCs 
      and found some similarities and differences. We revealed that both NGF and TGF-β1 
      could activate the PI3K-AKT signalling pathway (the expression of it in NGF was 
      higher) by targeting the ITGAs in the process of chondrogenesis from MSCs. However, 
      NGF could activate more proliferation and differentiation genes in the process of 
      chondrogenesis of MSCs, whereas TGF-β1 caused osteophyte formation by activating 
      THBS1 and THBS2. These might be the reason why NGF could promote cartilage 
      differentiation more specifically.

AB  - Allergen immunotherapy is a cornerstone in the treatment of allergic children. The 
      clinical efficiency relies on a well-defined immunologic mechanism promoting 
      regulatory T cells and downplaying the immune response induced by allergens. 
      Clinical indications have been well documented for respiratory allergy in the 
      presence of rhinitis and/or allergic asthma, to pollens and dust mites. Patients who 
      have had an anaphylactic reaction to hymenoptera venom are also good candidates for 
      allergen immunotherapy. Administration of allergen is currently mostly either by 
      subcutaneous injections or by sublingual administration. Both methods have been 
      extensively studied and have pros and cons. Specifically in children, the choice of 
      the method of administration according to the patient's profile is important. 
      Although allergen immunotherapy is widely used, there is a need for improvement. 
      More particularly, biomarkers for prediction of the success of the treatments are 
      needed. The strength and efficiency of the immune response may also be boosted by 
      the use of better adjuvants. Finally, novel formulations might be more efficient and 
      might improve the patient's adherence to the treatment. This user's guide reviews 
      current knowledge and aims to provide clinical guidance to healthcare professionals 
      taking care of children undergoing allergen immunotherapy.

AB  - Mobile health (mHealth) uses mobile communication devices such as smartphones and 
      tablet computers to support and improve health-related services, data and 
      information flow, patient self-management, surveillance, and disease management from 
      the moment of first diagnosis to an optimized treatment. The European Academy of 
      Allergy and Clinical Immunology created a task force to assess the state of the art 
      and future potential of mHealth in allergology. The task force endorsed the "Be 
      He@lthy, Be Mobile" WHO initiative and debated the quality, usability, efficiency, 
      advantages, limitations, and risks of mobile solutions for allergic diseases. The 
      results are summarized in this position paper, analyzing also the regulatory 
      background with regard to the "General Data Protection Regulation" and Medical 
      Directives of the European Community. The task force assessed the design, user 
      engagement, content, potential of inducing behavioral change, 
      credibility/accountability, and privacy policies of mHealth products. The 
      perspectives of healthcare professionals and allergic patients are discussed, 
      underlining the need of thorough investigation for an effective design of mHealth 
      technologies as auxiliary tools to improve quality of care. Within the context of 
      precision medicine, these could facilitate the change in perspective from clinician- 
      to patient-centered care. The current and future potential of mHealth is then 
      examined for specific areas of allergology, including allergic rhinitis, 
      aerobiology, allergen immunotherapy, asthma, dermatological diseases, food 
      allergies, anaphylaxis, insect venom, and drug allergy. The impact of mobile 
      technologies and associated big data sets are outlined. Facts and recommendations 
      for future mHealth initiatives within EAACI are listed.
