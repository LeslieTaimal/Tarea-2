TI  - A CRISPR-Cas autocatalysis-driven feedback amplification network for supersensitive 
      DNA diagnostics.

AB  - Artificial nucleic acid circuits with precisely controllable dynamic and function 
      have shown great promise in biosensing, but their utility in molecular diagnostics 
      is still restrained by the inability to process genomic DNA directly and moderate 
      sensitivity. To address this limitation, we present a CRISPR-Cas-powered catalytic 
      nucleic acid circuit, namely, CRISPR-Cas-only amplification network (CONAN), for 
      isothermally amplified detection of genomic DNA. By integrating the stringent target 
      recognition, helicase activity, and trans-cleavage activity of Cas12a, a Cas12a 
      autocatalysis-driven artificial reaction network is programmed to construct a 
      positive feedback circuit with exponential dynamic in CONAN. Consequently, CONAN 
      achieves one-enzyme, one-step, real-time detection of genomic DNA with attomolar 
      sensitivity. Moreover, CONAN increases the intrinsic single-base specificity of 
      Cas12a, and enables the effective detection of hepatitis B virus infection and human 
      bladder cancer-associated single-nucleotide mutation in clinical samples, 
      highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for disease diagnostics.

AB  - The CRISPR-Cas system initiated a revolution in genome editing when it was, for the 
      first time, demonstrated success in the mammalian cells. Today, scientists are able 
      to readily edit genomes, regulate gene transcription, engineer posttranscriptional 
      events, and image nucleic acids using CRISPR-Cas-based tools. However, to 
      efficiently transport CRISPR-Cas into target tissues/cells remains challenging due 
      to many extra- and intra-cellular barriers, therefore largely limiting the 
      applications of CRISPR-based therapeutics in vivo. In this review, we summarize the 
      features of plasmid-, RNA- and ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-based CRISPR-Cas 
      therapeutics. Then, we survey the current in vivo delivery systems. We specify the 
      requirements for efficient in vivo delivery in clinical settings, and highlight both 
      efficiency and safety for different CRISPR-Cas tools.

AB  - In this opinion article we highlight links between the H-NS nucleoid-associated 
      protein, variable DNA topology, the regulation of CRISPR-cas locus expression, 
      CRISPR-Cas activity, and the recruitment of novel genetic information by the CRISPR 
      array. We propose that the requirement that the invading mobile genetic element be 
      negatively supercoiled limits effective CRISPR action to a window in the bacterial 
      growth cycle when DNA topology is optimal, and that this same window is used for the 
      efficient integration of new spacer sequences at the CRISPR array. H-NS silences 
      CRISPR promoters, and we propose that antagonists of H-NS, such as the LeuO 
      transcription factor, provide a basis for a stochastic genetic switch that acts at 
      random in each cell in the bacterial population. In addition, we wish to propose a 
      mechanism by which mobile genetic elements can suppress CRISPR-cas transcription 
      using H-NS homologues. Although the individual components of this network are known, 
      we propose a new model in which they are integrated and linked to the physiological 
      state of the bacterium. The model provides a basis for cell-to-cell variation in the 
      expression and performance of CRISPR systems in bacterial populations.

AB  - Since its first demonstration for mammalian gene editing, CRISPR/Cas technology has 
      been widely adopted in research, industry, and medicine. Beyond indel mutations 
      induced by Cas9 activity, recent advances in CRISPR/Cas have enabled DNA or RNA base 
      editing. In addition, multiple orthogonal methods for the spatiotemporal regulation 
      of CRISPR/Cas activity and repurposed Cas proteins for the visualization and 
      relocation of specific genomic loci in living cells have been described. By 
      harnessing the versatility of CRISPR/Cas-based devices and gene circuits, synthetic 
      biologists are developing memory devices for lineage tracing and technologies for 
      unbiased, high-throughput interrogation of combinatorial gene perturbations. We 
      envision that such approaches will enable researchers to gain deeper insights into 
      the translation of genotypes to phenotypes in healthy and diseased states.

AB  - DNA is the source of genetic information, and preserving its integrity is essential 
      in order to sustain life. The genome is continuously threatened by different types 
      of DNA lesions, such as abasic sites, mismatches, interstrand crosslinks, or 
      single-stranded and double-stranded breaks. As a consequence, cells have evolved 
      specialized DNA damage response (DDR) mechanisms to sustain genome integrity. By 
      orchestrating multilayer signaling cascades specific for the type of lesion that 
      occurred, the DDR ensures that genetic information is preserved overtime. In the 
      last decades, DNA repair mechanisms have been thoroughly investigated to untangle 
      these complex networks of pathways and processes. As a result, key factors have been 
      identified that control and coordinate DDR circuits in time and space. In the first 
      part of this review, we describe the critical processes encompassing DNA damage 
      sensing and resolution. In the second part, we illustrate the consequences of 
      partial or complete failure of the DNA repair machinery. Lastly, we will report 
      examples in which this knowledge has been instrumental to develop novel therapies 
      based on genome editing technologies, such as CRISPR-Cas.

AB  - CRISPR-Cas is a prokaryotic adaptive immune system that functions by incorporating 
      fragments of foreign DNA into CRISPR arrays. The arrays containing spacers derived 
      from foreign DNA are transcribed, and the transcripts are processed to generate 
      spacer-containing mature CRISPR-RNAs that are employed as guides to specifically 
      recognize and cleave the DNA or RNA of the cognate parasitic genetic elements. The 
      CRISPR-Cas systems show remarkable complexity and diversity of molecular 
      organization and appear to be involved in various cellular functions that are 
      distinct from, even if connected to, adaptive immunity. In this review, we discuss 
      some of such functional links of CRISPR-Cas systems including their effect on 
      horizontal gene transfer that can be either inhibitory or stimulatory, connections 
      between CRISPR-Cas and DNA repair systems as well as programmed cell death and 
      signal transduction mechanisms, and potential role of CRISPR-Cas in transposon 
      integration and plasmid maintenance. The interplay between the primary function of 
      CRISPR-Cas as an adaptive immunity mechanism and these other roles defines the 
      richness of the biological effects of these systems and affects their spread among 
      bacteria and archaea.

AB  - CRISPR-Cas systems have, over the years, emerged as indispensable tools for Genetic 
      interrogation in contexts of clinical interventions, elucidation of genetic pathways 
      and metabolic engineering and have pervaded almost every aspect of modern biology. 
      Within this repertoire, the nervous system comes with its own set of perplexities 
      and mysteries. Scientists have, over the years, tried to draw up a clearer genetic 
      picture of the neuron and how it functions in a network, mainly in an endeavor to 
      mitigate diseases of the human nervous system like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, 
      Huntington's, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), etc. With most being progressive in 
      nature, these diseases have plagued mankind for centuries. In spite of our immense 
      progress in modern biology, we are yet to get a grasp over these diseases and 
      unraveling their mechanisms is of utmost importance. Before CRISPR-Cas systems came 
      along, the elucidation of the complex interactome of the mammalian nervous system 
      was attempted with erstwhile existing electrophysiological, histological and 
      pharmacological techniques coupled with Next Generation Sequencing and cell-specific 
      targeting technologies. Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription 
      activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), imparted excellent sequence specific DNA 
      targeting capabilities but came with their huge baggage of extensive protein 
      engineering requirements, which practically rendered them unsuitable for high 
      throughput exercises. With the discovery of Clustered Regularly Interspaced 
      Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR Associated proteins(CAS) systems by Ishino 
      (1987)(1), the era of extensive custom made endonuclease targeting was ushered in. 
      For the first time in 2012, Jinek et al. (2012)(2) repurposed the CRISPR-Cas 
      mediated bacterial immune system for customizable mammalian gene editing. The 
      CRISPR-Cas technology made it possible to easily customize Cas9 endonucleases to 
      cleave near specifically targeted sequences, thereby facilitating knock-ins or 
      knock-outs, silencing or activating or editing any gene, at any locus of the genome, 
      both at the base-pair level or at the epigenetic level. With this enhanced degree of 
      freedom, decrypting the nervous system and therapeutic interventions for 
      neuropathies became significantly less cumbersome an exercise. Here we take a brisk 
      walk through the several endeavors of research that show how the humble bacteria's 
      CRISPR-Cas system gave us the "nerves" to "talk" to our nerves with ease.

AB  - The ability to artificially control transcription is essential both to the study of 
      gene function and to the construction of synthetic gene networks with desired 
      properties. Cas9 is an RNA-guided double-stranded DNA nuclease that participates in 
      the CRISPR-Cas immune defense against prokaryotic viruses. We describe the use of a 
      Cas9 nuclease mutant that retains DNA-binding activity and can be engineered as a 
      programmable transcription repressor by preventing the binding of the RNA polymerase 
      (RNAP) to promoter sequences or as a transcription terminator by blocking the 
      running RNAP. In addition, a fusion between the omega subunit of the RNAP and a Cas9 
      nuclease mutant directed to bind upstream promoter regions can achieve programmable 
      transcription activation. The simple and efficient modulation of gene expression 
      achieved by this technology is a useful asset for the study of gene networks and for 
      the development of synthetic biology and biotechnological applications.

AB  - The term 'clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats' (CRISPR) has 
      recently become synonymous with the genome-editing revolution. The RNA-guided 
      endonuclease CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9), in particular, has attracted 
      attention for its promise in basic research and gene editing-based therapeutics. 
      CRISPR-Cas systems are efficient and easily programmable nucleic acid-targeting 
      tools, with uses reaching beyond research and therapeutic development into the 
      precision breeding of plants and animals and the engineering of industrial microbes. 
      CRISPR-Cas systems have potential for many microbial engineering applications, 
      including bacterial strain typing, immunization of cultures, autoimmunity or 
      self-targeted cell killing, and the engineering or control of metabolic pathways for 
      improved biochemical synthesis. In this review, we explore the fundamental 
      characteristics of CRISPR-Cas systems and highlight how these features can be used 
      in industrial settings.

AB  - RNA-based regulation and CRISPR/Cas transcription factors (CRISPR-TFs) have the 
      potential to be integrated for the tunable modulation of gene networks. A major 
      limitation of this methodology is that guide RNAs (gRNAs) for CRISPR-TFs can only be 
      expressed from RNA polymerase III promoters in human cells, limiting their use for 
      conditional gene regulation. We present new strategies that enable expression of 
      functional gRNAs from RNA polymerase II promoters and multiplexed production of 
      proteins and gRNAs from a single transcript in human cells. We use multiple RNA 
      regulatory strategies, including RNA-triple-helix structures, introns, microRNAs, 
      and ribozymes, with Cas9-based CRISPR-TFs and Cas6/Csy4-based RNA processing. Using 
      these tools, we efficiently modulate endogenous promoters and implement tunable 
      synthetic circuits, including multistage cascades and RNA-dependent networks that 
      can be rewired with Csy4 to achieve complex behaviors. This toolkit can be used for 
      programming scalable gene circuits and perturbing endogenous networks for biology, 
      therapeutic, and synthetic biology applications.

AB  - The CRISPR-Cas system has rapidly reached a huge popularity as a new, powerful 
      method for precise DNA editing and genome reengineering. In Synthetic Biology, the 
      CRISPR-Cas type II system has inspired the construction of a novel class of 
      RNA-based transcription factors. In their simplest form, they are made of a CRISPR 
      RNA molecule, which targets a promoter sequence, and a deficient Cas9 (i.e. deprived 
      of any nuclease activity) that has been fused to an activation or a repression 
      domain. Up- and downregulation of single genes in mammalian and yeast cells have 
      been achieved with satisfactory results. Moreover, the construction of CRISPR-based 
      transcription factors is much simpler than the assembly of synthetic proteins such 
      as the Transcription Activator-Like effectors. However, the feasibility of complex 
      synthetic networks fully based on the CRISPR-dCas9 technology has still to be proved 
      and new designs, which take into account different CRISPR types, shall be 
      investigated.

TI  - CRISPR Screens in Plants: Approaches, Guidelines, and Future Prospects.

AB  - CRISPR-Cas systems have revolutionized genome engineering by facilitating a wide 
      range of targeted DNA perturbations. These systems have resulted in new powerful 
      screens to test gene functions at the genomic scale. While there is tremendous 
      potential for CRISPR screens to map and interrogate gene regulatory networks at 
      unprecedented speed and scale, their implementation in plants remains in its 
      infancy. Here we discuss the general concepts, tools and workflows for establishing 
      CRISPR screens in plants and analyze the handful of recent reports using this 
      strategy to generate mutant knockout collections or diversify DNA sequences. In 
      addition, we provide insight on how to design CRISPR knockout screens in plants 
      given the current challenges and limitations and examine multiple design options. 
      Finally, we discuss the unique multiplexing capabilities of CRISPR screens to 
      investigate redundant gene function in highly duplicated plant genomes. 
      Combinatorial mutant screens have the potential to routinely generate higher-order 
      mutant collections and facilitate the characterization of gene networks. By 
      integrating this approach with the large resource of genomic profiles that were 
      generated in the last two decades, the implementation of CRISPR screens offers new 
      opportunities to analyze plant genomes at deeper resolution and will greatly advance 
      plant functional and synthetic biology.

AB  - According to the latest report from the World Health Organization, an estimated 
      265,000 deaths still occur every year as a direct result of burn injuries. A 
      widespread range of these deaths induced by burn wound happens in low- and 
      middle-income countries, where survivors face a lifetime of morbidity. Most of the 
      deaths occur due to infections when a high percentage of the external regions of the 
      body area is affected. Microbial nutrient availability, skin barrier disruption, and 
      vascular supply destruction in burn injuries as well as systemic immunosuppression 
      are important parameters that cause burns to be susceptible to infections. Topical 
      antimicrobials and dressings are generally employed to inhibit burn infections 
      followed by a burn wound therapy, because systemic antibiotics have problems in 
      reaching the infected site, coupled with increasing microbial drug resistance. 
      Nanotechnology has provided a range of molecular designed nanostructures (NS) that 
      can be used in both therapeutic and diagnostic applications in burns. These NSs can 
      be divided into organic and non-organic (such as polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) and 
      silver NPs, respectively), and many have been designed to display multifunctional 
      activity. The present review covers the physiology of skin, burn classification, 
      burn wound pathogenesis, animal models of burn wound infection, and various topical 
      therapeutic approaches designed to combat infection and stimulate healing. These 
      include biological based approaches (e.g. immune-based antimicrobial molecules, 
      therapeutic microorganisms, antimicrobial agents, etc.), antimicrobial photo- and 
      ultrasound-therapy, as well as nanotechnology-based wound healing approaches as a 
      revolutionizing area. Thus, we focus on organic and non-organic NSs designed to 
      deliver growth factors to burned skin, and scaffolds, dressings, etc. for exogenous 
      stem cells to aid skin regeneration. Eventually, recent breakthroughs and 
      technologies with substantial potentials in tissue regeneration and skin wound 
      therapy (that are as the basis of burn wound therapies) are briefly taken into 
      consideration including 3D-printing, cell-imprinted substrates, nano-architectured 
      surfaces, and novel gene-editing tools such as CRISPR-Cas.

TI  - Clades of huge phages from across Earth's ecosystems.
PG  - 425-431
LID - 10.1038/s41586-020-2007-4 [doi]
AB  - Bacteriophages typically have small genomes(1) and depend on their bacterial hosts 
      for replication(2). Here we sequenced DNA from diverse ecosystems and found hundreds 
      of phage genomes with lengths of more than 200 kilobases (kb), including a genome of 
      735 kb, which is-to our knowledge-the largest phage genome to be described to date. 
      Thirty-five genomes were manually curated to completion (circular and no gaps). 
      Expanded genetic repertoires include diverse and previously undescribed CRISPR-Cas 
      systems, transfer RNAs (tRNAs), tRNA synthetases, tRNA-modification enzymes, 
      translation-initiation and elongation factors, and ribosomal proteins. The 
      CRISPR-Cas systems of phages have the capacity to silence host transcription factors 
      and translational genes, potentially as part of a larger interaction network that 
      intercepts translation to redirect biosynthesis to phage-encoded functions. In 
      addition, some phages may repurpose bacterial CRISPR-Cas systems to eliminate 
      competing phages. We phylogenetically define the major clades of huge phages from 
      human and other animal microbiomes, as well as from oceans, lakes, sediments, soils 
      and the built environment. We conclude that the large gene inventories of huge 
      phages reflect a conserved biological strategy, and that the phages are distributed 
      across a broad bacterial host range and across Earth's ecosystems.

AB  - Cas13 has demonstrated unique and broad utility in RNA editing, nucleic acid 
      detection, and disease diagnosis; however, a constantly active Cas enzyme may induce 
      unwanted effects. Bacteriophage- or prophage-region-encoded anti-CRISPR (acr) gene 
      molecules provide the potential to control targeting specificity and potency to 
      allow for optimal RNA editing and nucleic acid detection by spatiotemporally 
      modulating endonuclease activities. Using integrated approaches to screen acrVI 
      candidates and evaluate their effects on Cas13 function, we discovered a series of 
      acrVIA1-7 genes that block the activities of Cas13a. These VI-A CRISPR inhibitors 
      substantially attenuate RNA targeting and editing by Cas13a in human cells. 
      Strikingly, type VI-A anti-CRISPRs (AcrVIAs) also significantly muffle the 
      single-nucleic-acid editing ability of the dCas13a RNA-editing system. 
      Mechanistically, AcrVIA1, -4, -5, and -6 bind LwaCas13a, while AcrVIA2 and -3 can 
      only bind the LwaCas13-crRNA (CRISPR RNA) complex. These identified acr molecules 
      may enable precise RNA editing in Cas13-based application and study of 
      phage-bacterium interaction.

AB  - A diversity of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas 
      systems provide adaptive immunity to bacteria and archaea through recording 
      "memories" of past viral infections. Recently, many novel CRISPR-associated proteins 
      have been discovered via computational studies, but those studies relied on biased 
      and incomplete databases of assembled genomes. We avoided these biases and applied a 
      network theory approach to search for novel CRISPR-associated genes by leveraging 
      subtle ecological cooccurrence patterns identified from environmental metagenomes. 
      We validated our method using existing annotations and discovered 32 novel 
      CRISPR-associated gene families. These genes span a range of putative functions, 
      with many potentially regulating the response to infection.IMPORTANCE Every branch 
      on the tree of life, including microbial life, faces the threat of viral pathogens. 
      Over the course of billions of years of coevolution, prokaryotes have evolved a 
      great diversity of strategies to defend against viral infections. One of these is 
      the CRISPR adaptive immune system, which allows microbes to "remember" past 
      infections in order to better fight them in the future. There has been much interest 
      among molecular biologists in CRISPR immunity because this system can be repurposed 
      as a tool for precise genome editing. Recently, a number of comparative genomics 
      approaches have been used to detect novel CRISPR-associated genes in databases of 
      genomes with great success, potentially leading to the development of new 
      genome-editing tools. Here, we developed novel methods to search for these distinct 
      classes of genes directly in environmental samples ("metagenomes"), thus capturing a 
      more complete picture of the natural diversity of CRISPR-associated genes.

AB  - CRISPR-Cas is a powerful genome editing technology and has a great potential for in 
      vivo gene therapy. Successful translational application of CRISPR-Cas to biomedicine 
      still faces many safety concerns, including off-target side effect, cell fitness 
      problem after CRISPR-Cas treatment, and on-target genome editing side effect in 
      undesired tissues. To solve these issues, it is needed to design sgRNA with high 
      cell-specific efficacy and specificity. Existing single-guide RNA (sgRNA) design 
      tools mainly depend on a sgRNA sequence and the local information of the targeted 
      genome, thus are not sufficient to account for the difference in the cellular 
      response of the same gene in different cell types. To incorporate cell-specific 
      information into the sgRNA design, we develop novel interpretable machine learning 
      models, which integrate features learned from advanced transformer-based deep neural 
      network with cell-specific gene property derived from biological network and gene 
      expression profile, for the prediction of CRISPR-Cas9 and CRISPR-Cas12a efficacy and 
      specificity. In benchmark studies, our models significantly outperform 
      state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, we find that the network-based gene 
      property is critical for the prediction of cell-specific post-treatment cellular 
      response. Our results suggest that the design of efficient and safe CRISPR-Cas needs 
      to consider cell-specific information of genes. Our findings may bolster developing 
      more accurate predictive models of CRISPR-Cas across a broad spectrum of biological 
      conditions as well as provide new insight into developing efficient and safe 
      CRISPR-based gene therapy.

TI  - In Vivo Epigenetic CRISPR Screen Identifies Asf1a as an Immunotherapeutic Target in 
      Kras-Mutant Lung Adenocarcinoma.
PG  - 270-287
LID - 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-19-0780 [doi]
AB  - Despite substantial progress in lung cancer immunotherapy, the overall response rate 
      in patients with KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains low. Combining 
      standard immunotherapy with adjuvant approaches that enhance adaptive immune 
      responses-such as epigenetic modulation of antitumor immunity-is therefore an 
      attractive strategy. To identify epigenetic regulators of tumor immunity, we 
      constructed an epigenetic-focused single guide RNA library and performed an in vivo 
      CRISPR screen in a Kras (G12D)/Trp53 (-/-) LUAD model. Our data showed that loss of 
      the histone chaperone Asf1a in tumor cells sensitizes tumors to anti-PD-1 treatment. 
      Mechanistic studies revealed that tumor cell-intrinsic Asf1a deficiency induced 
      immunogenic macrophage differentiation in the tumor microenvironment by upregulating 
      GM-CSF expression and potentiated T-cell activation in combination with anti-PD-1. 
      Our results provide a rationale for a novel combination therapy consisting of ASF1A 
      inhibition and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. SIGNIFICANCE: Using an in vivo epigenetic 
      CRISPR screen, we identified Asf1a as a critical regulator of LUAD sensitivity to 
      anti-PD-1 therapy. Asf1a deficiency synergized with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy by 
      promoting M1-like macrophage polarization and T-cell activation. Thus, we provide a 
      new immunotherapeutic strategy for this subtype of patients with LUAD.See related

AB  - One of the biggest threats we face globally is the emergence of 
      antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria, which runs in parallel with the lack in the 
      development of new antimicrobials. Among these AMR bacteria pathogens belonging to 
      the ESKAPE group can be highlighted (Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, 
      Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 
      Enterobacter spp.) due to their profile of drug resistance and virulence. Therefore, 
      innovative lines of treatment must be developed for these bacteria. In this review, 
      we summarize the different strategies for the treatment and study of molecular 
      mechanisms of AMR in the ESKAPE pathogens based on the clustered regularly 
      interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins' 
      technologies: loss of plasmid or cellular viability, random mutation or gene 
      deletion as well directed mutations that lead to a gene's loss of function.

PG  - 2701-2722
LID - 10.1007/s00018-020-03449-3 [doi]
AB  - Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a complex plastic and reversible 
      cellular process that has critical roles in diverse physiological and pathological 
      phenomena. EMT is involved in embryonic development, organogenesis and tissue 
      repair, as well as in fibrosis, cancer metastasis and drug resistance. In recent 
      years, the ability to edit the genome using the clustered regularly interspaced 
      palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and associated protein (Cas) system has greatly 
      contributed to identify or validate critical genes in pathway signaling. This review 
      delineates the complex EMT networks and discusses recent studies that have used 
      CRISPR/Cas technology to further advance our understanding of the EMT process.

AB  - Regulatory RNAs, present in many bacterial genomes and particularly in pathogenic 
      bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, control the expression of genes encoding 
      virulence factors or metabolic proteins. They are extremely diverse and include 
      noncoding RNAs (sRNA), antisense RNAs, and some 5' or 3' untranslated regions of 
      messenger RNAs that act as sensors for metabolites, tRNAs, or environmental 
      conditions (e.g., temperature, pH). In this review we focus on specific examples of 
      sRNAs of S. aureus that illustrate how numerous sRNAs and associated proteins are 
      embedded in complex networks of regulation. In addition, we discuss the CRISPR-Cas 
      systems defined as an RNA-interference-like mechanism, which also exist in 
      staphylococcal strains.

AB  - The well-designed microbial cell factory finds wide applications in chemical, 
      pharmaceutical, and food industries due to its sustainable and environmentally 
      friendly features. Recently, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic 
      repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated proteins (CRISPR-Cas) systems have been 
      developed into powerful tools to perform genome editing and transcriptional 
      regulation in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Accordingly, these tools are useful 
      to build microbial cell factories not only by reconstructing the genome but also by 
      reprogramming the metabolic network. In this review, we summarize the recent 
      significant headway and potential uses of the CRISPR technology in the construction 
      of efficient microbial cell factories. Moreover, the future perspectives on the 
      improvement and upgradation of CRISPR-based tools are also discussed.

TI  - The network structure and eco-evolutionary dynamics of CRISPR-induced immune 
      diversification.
PG  - 1650-1660
LID - 10.1038/s41559-020-01312-z [doi]
AB  - As a heritable sequence-specific adaptive immune system, CRISPR-Cas is a powerful 
      force shaping strain diversity in host-virus systems. While the diversity of CRISPR 
      alleles has been explored, the associated structure and dynamics of host-virus 
      interactions have not. We explore the role of CRISPR in mediating the interplay 
      between host-virus interaction structure and eco-evolutionary dynamics in a 
      computational model and compare the results with three empirical datasets from 
      natural systems. We show that the structure of the networks describing who infects 
      whom and the degree to which strains are immune, are respectively modular 
      (containing groups of hosts and viruses that interact strongly) and weighted-nested 
      (specialist hosts are more susceptible to subsets of viruses that in turn also 
      infect the more generalist hosts with many spacers matching many viruses). The 
      dynamic interplay between these networks influences transitions between dynamical 
      regimes of virus diversification and host control. The three empirical systems 
      exhibit weighted-nested immunity networks, a pattern our theory shows is indicative 
      of hosts able to suppress virus diversification. Previously missing from studies of 
      microbial host-pathogen systems, the immunity network plays a key role in the 
      coevolutionary dynamics.

AB  - Despite rapid progresses in the genome-editing field, in vivo simultaneous 
      overexpression of multiple genes remains challenging. We generated a transgenic 
      mouse using an improved dCas9 system that enables simultaneous and precise in vivo 
      transcriptional activation of multiple genes and long noncoding RNAs in the nervous 
      system. As proof of concept, we were able to use targeted activation of endogenous 
      neurogenic genes in these transgenic mice to directly and efficiently convert 
      astrocytes into functional neurons in vivo. This system provides a flexible and 
      rapid screening platform for studying complex gene networks and gain-of-function 
      phenotypes in the mammalian brain.

AB  - A highly effective metabolic pathway is the key for an efficient cell factory. 
      However, the engineered homologous or heterologous multi-gene pathway may be 
      unbalanced, inefficient and causing the accumulation of potentially toxic 
      intermediates. Therefore, pathways must be constructed optimally to minimize these 
      negative effects and maximize catalytic efficiency. With the development of CRISPR 
      technology, some of the problems of previous pathway engineering and genome editing 
      techniques were resolved, providing higher efficiency, lower cost, and easily 
      customizable targets. Moreover, CRISPR was demonstrated as robust and effective in 
      various organisms including both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In recent years, 
      researchers in the field of metabolic engineering and synthetic biology have 
      exploited various CRISPR-based pathway engineering approaches, which are both 
      effective and convenient, as well as valuable from a theoretical standpoint. In this 
      review, we systematically summarize novel pathway engineering techniques and 
      strategies based on CRISPR nucleases system, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), and 
      CRISPR activation (CRISPRa), including figures and descriptions for easy 
      understanding, with the aim to facilitate their broader application among fellow 
      researchers.

TI  - Cullin5 deficiency promotes small-cell lung cancer metastasis by stabilizing 
      integrin β1.
PG  - 972-987

AB  - Metastasis is the dominant cause of patient death in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), 
      and a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying SCLC metastasis 
      may potentially improve clinical treatment. Through genome-scale screening for key 
      regulators of mouse Rb1-/- Trp53-/- SCLC metastasis using the pooled CRISPR/Cas9 
      library, we identified Cullin5 (CUL5) and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 
      (SOCS3), two components of the Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, as top 
      candidates. Mechanistically, the deficiency of CUL5 or SOCS3 disrupted the 
      functional formation of the E3 ligase complex and prevented the degradation of 
      integrin β1, which stabilized integrin β1 and activated downstream focal adhesion 
      kinase/SRC (FAK/SRC) signaling and eventually drove SCLC metastasis. Low expression 
      levels of CUL5 and SOCS3 were significantly associated with high integrin β1 levels 
      and poor prognosis in a large cohort of 128 clinical patients with SCLC. Moreover, 
      the CUL5-deficient SCLCs were vulnerable to the treatment of the FDA-approved SRC 
      inhibitor dasatinib. Collectively, this work identifies the essential role of CUL5- 
      and SOCS3-mediated integrin β1 turnover in controlling SCLC metastasis, which might 
      have therapeutic implications.

AB  - Methods to regulate gene expression programs in bacterial cells are limited by the 
      absence of effective gene activators. To address this challenge, we have developed 
      synthetic bacterial transcriptional activators in E. coli by linking activation 
      domains to programmable CRISPR-Cas DNA binding domains. Effective gene activation 
      requires target sites situated in a narrow region just upstream of the transcription 
      start site, in sharp contrast to the relatively flexible target site requirements 
      for gene activation in eukaryotic cells. Together with existing tools for CRISPRi 
      gene repression, these bacterial activators enable programmable control over 
      multiple genes with simultaneous activation and repression. Further, the entire gene 
      expression program can be switched on by inducing expression of the CRISPR-Cas 
      system. This work will provide a foundation for engineering synthetic bacterial 
      cellular devices with applications including diagnostics, therapeutics, and 
      industrial biosynthesis.

AB  - In metabolic engineering, genome editing tools make it much easier to discover and 
      evaluate relevant genes and pathways and construct strains. Clustered regularly 
      interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated (Cas) systems now have become 
      the first choice for genome engineering in many organisms includingindustrially 
      relevant ones. Targeted DNA cleavage by CRISPR-Cas provides variousgenome 
      engineering modes such as indels, replacements, large deletions, knock-in and 
      chromosomal rearrangements, while host-dependent differences in repair pathways need 
      to be considered. The versatility of the CRISPR system has given rise to derivative 
      technologies that complement nuclease-based editing, which causes cytotoxicity 
      especially in microorganisms. Deaminase-mediated base editing installs targeted 
      point mutations with much less toxicity. CRISPRi and CRISPRa can temporarily control 
      gene expression without changing the genomic sequence. Multiplex, combinatorial and 
      large scale editing are made possible by streamlined design and construction of gRNA 
      libraries to further accelerates comprehensive discovery, evaluation and building of 
      metabolic pathways. This review summarizes the technical basis and recent advances 
      in CRISPR-related genome editing tools applied for metabolic engineering purposes, 
      with representative examples of industrially relevant eukaryotic and prokaryotic 
      organisms.

AB  - The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats associated Cas9/sgRNA 
      system is a novel targeted genome-editing technique derived from bacterial immune 
      system. It is an inexpensive, easy, most user friendly and rapidly adopted genome 
      editing tool transforming to revolutionary paradigm. This technique enables precise 
      genomic modifications in many different organisms and tissues. Cas9 protein is an 
      RNA guided endonuclease utilized for creating targeted double-stranded breaks with 
      only a short RNA sequence to confer recognition of the target in animals and plants. 
      Development of genetically edited (GE) crops similar to those developed by 
      conventional or mutation breeding using this potential technique makes it a 
      promising and extremely versatile tool for providing sustainable productive 
      agriculture for better feeding of rapidly growing population in a changing climate. 
      The emerging areas of research for the genome editing in plants include 
      interrogating gene function, rewiring the regulatory signaling networks and sgRNA 
      library for high-throughput loss-of-function screening. In this review, we have 
      described the broad applicability of the Cas9 nuclease mediated targeted plant 
      genome editing for development of designer crops. The regulatory uncertainty and 
      social acceptance of plant breeding by Cas9 genome editing have also been described. 
      With this powerful and innovative technique the designer GE non-GM plants could 
      further advance climate resilient and sustainable agriculture in the future and 
      maximizing yield by combating abiotic and biotic stresses.

AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), also known as multipotent mesenchymal stromal stem 
      cells, are found in the perivascular space of several tissues. These cells have been 
      subject of intense research in the last decade due to their low teratogenicity, as 
      well as their ability to differentiate into mature cells and to secrete 
      immunomodulatory and trophic factors. However, they usually promote only a modest 
      benefit when transplanted in experimental disease models, one of the limitations for 
      their clinical application. The CRISPR-Cas system, in turn, is highlighted as a 
      simple and effective tool for genetic engineering. This system was tested in 
      clinical trials over a relatively short period of time after establishing its 
      applicability to the edition of the mammalian cell genome. Similar to the research 
      evolution in MSCs, the CRISPR-Cas system demonstrated inconsistencies that limited 
      its clinical application. In this review, we outline the evolution of MSC research 
      and its applicability, and the progress of the CRISPR-Cas system from its discovery 
      to the most recent clinical trials. We also propose perspectives on how the 
      CRISPR-Cas system may improve the therapeutic potential of MSCs, making it more 
      beneficial and long lasting.

      in human microbiomes.
PG  - R40
LID - 10.1186/gb-2013-14-4-r40 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria and archaea develop immunity against invading genomes by 
      incorporating pieces of the invaders' sequences, called spacers, into a clustered 
      regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) locus between repeats, 
      forming arrays of repeat-spacer units. When spacers are expressed, they direct 
      CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins to silence complementary invading DNA. In order to 
      characterize the invaders of human microbiomes, we use spacers from CRISPR arrays 
      that we had previously assembled from shotgun metagenomic datasets, and identify 
      contigs that contain these spacers' targets. RESULTS: We discover 95,000 contigs 
      that are putative invasive mobile genetic elements, some targeted by hundreds of 
      CRISPR spacers. We find that oral sites in healthy human populations have a much 
      greater variety of mobile genetic elements than stool samples. Mobile genetic 
      elements carry genes encoding diverse functions: only 7% of the mobile genetic 
      elements are similar to known phages or plasmids, although a much greater proportion 
      contain phage- or plasmid-related genes. A small number of contigs share similarity 
      with known integrative and conjugative elements, providing the first examples of 
      CRISPR defenses against this class of element. We provide detailed analyses of a few 
      large mobile genetic elements of various types, and a relative abundance analysis of 
      mobile genetic elements and putative hosts, exploring the dynamic activities of 
      mobile genetic elements in human microbiomes. A joint analysis of mobile genetic 
      elements and CRISPRs shows that protospacer-adjacent motifs drive their interaction 
      network; however, some CRISPR-Cas systems target mobile genetic elements lacking 
      motifs. CONCLUSIONS: We identify a large collection of invasive mobile genetic 
      elements in human microbiomes, an important resource for further study of the 
      interaction between the CRISPR-Cas immune system and invaders.

AB  - Reprogramming complex cellular metabolism requires simultaneous regulation of 
      multigene expression. Ex-situ cloning-based methods are commonly used, but the 
      target gene number and combinatorial library size are severely limited by cloning 
      and transformation efficiencies. In-situ methods such as multiplex automated genome 
      engineering (MAGE) depends on high-efficiency transformation and incorporation of 
      heterologous DNA donors, which are limited to few microorganisms. Here, we describe 
      a Base Editor-Targeted and Template-free Expression Regulation (BETTER) method for 
      simultaneously diversifying multigene expression. BETTER repurposes CRISPR-guided 
      base editors and in-situ generates large numbers of genetic combinations of diverse 
      ribosome binding sites, 5' untranslated regions, or promoters, without library 
      construction, transformation, and incorporation of DNA donors. We apply BETTER to 
      simultaneously regulate expression of up to ten genes in industrial and model 
      microorganisms Corynebacterium glutamicum and Bacillus subtilis. Variants with 
      improved xylose catabolism, glycerol catabolism, or lycopene biosynthesis are 
      respectively obtained. This technology will be useful for large-scale fine-tuning of 
      multigene expression in both genetically tractable and intractable microorganisms.

AB  - Systematic mapping of genetic interactions (GIs) and interrogation of the functions 
      of sizable genomic segments in mammalian cells represent important goals of 
      biomedical research. To advance these goals, we present a CRISPR (clustered 
      regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-based screening system for 
      combinatorial genetic manipulation that employs coexpression of CRISPR-associated 
      nucleases 9 and 12a (Cas9 and Cas12a) and machine-learning-optimized libraries of 
      hybrid Cas9-Cas12a guide RNAs. This system, named Cas Hybrid for Multiplexed Editing 
      and screening Applications (CHyMErA), outperforms genetic screens using Cas9 or 
      Cas12a editing alone. Application of CHyMErA to the ablation of mammalian paralog 
      gene pairs reveals extensive GIs and uncovers phenotypes normally masked by 
      functional redundancy. Application of CHyMErA in a chemogenetic interaction screen 
      identifies genes that impact cell growth in response to mTOR pathway inhibition. 
      Moreover, by systematically targeting thousands of alternative splicing events, 
      CHyMErA identifies exons underlying human cell line fitness. CHyMErA thus represents 
      an effective screening approach for GI mapping and the functional analysis of 
      sizable genomic regions, such as alternative exons.

TI  - Epigenetic CRISPR Screens Identify Npm1 as a Therapeutic Vulnerability in Non-Small 
      Cell Lung Cancer.
PG  - 3556-3567
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-19-3782 [doi]
AB  - Despite advancements in treatment options, the overall cure and survival rates for 
      non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) remain low. While small-molecule inhibitors of 
      epigenetic regulators have recently emerged as promising cancer therapeutics, their 
      application in patients with NSCLC is limited. To exploit epigenetic regulators as 
      novel therapeutic targets in NSCLC, we performed pooled epigenome-wide CRISPR 
      knockout screens in vitro and in vivo and identified the histone chaperone 
      nucleophosmin 1 (Npm1) as a potential therapeutic target. Genetic ablation of Npm1 
      significantly attenuated tumor progression in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, 
      KRAS-mutant cancer cells were more addicted to NPM1 expression. Genetic ablation of 
      Npm1 rewired the balance of metabolism in cancer cells from predominant aerobic 
      glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation and reduced the population of 
      tumor-propagating cells. Overall, our results support NPM1 as a therapeutic 
      vulnerability in NSCLC. SIGNIFICANCE: Epigenome-wide CRISPR knockout screens 
      identify NPM1 as a novel metabolic vulnerability and demonstrate that targeting NPM1 
      is a new therapeutic opportunity for patients with NSCLC.

AB  - At the end of 2019, a new disease appeared and spread all over the world, the 
      COVID-19, produced by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. As a consequence of this worldwide 
      health crisis, the scientific community began to redirect their knowledge and 
      resources to fight against it. Here we summarize the recent research on viruses 
      employed as therapy and diagnostic of COVID-19: (i) viral-vector vaccines both in 
      clinical trials and pre-clinical phases; (ii) the use of bacteriophages to find 
      antibodies specific to this virus and some studies of how to use the bacteriophages 
      themselves as a treatment against viral diseases; and finally, (iii) the use of 
      CRISPR-Cas technology both to obtain a fast precise diagnose of the patient and also 
      the possible use of this technology as a cure.

TI  - Unexpected connections between type VI-B CRISPR-Cas systems, bacterial natural

AB  - In addition to core Cas proteins, CRISPR-Cas loci often encode ancillary proteins 
      that modulate the activity of the respective effectors in interference. Subtype 
      VI-B1 CRISPR-Cas systems encode the Csx27 protein that down-regulates the activity 
      of Cas13b when the type VI-B locus is expressed in Escherichia coli. We show that 
      Csx27 belongs to an expansive family of proteins that contain four predicted 
      transmembrane helices and are typically encoded in predicted operons with components 
      of the bacterial natural transformation machinery, multidomain proteins that consist 
      of components of the ubiquitin signaling system and proteins containing the 
      ligand-binding WYL domain and a helix-turn-helix domain. The Csx27 family proteins 
      are predicted to form membrane channels for ssDNA that might comprise the core of a 
      putative novel, Ub-regulated system for DNA uptake and, possibly, degradation. In 
      addition to these associations, a distinct subfamily of the Csx27 family appears to 
      be a part of a novel, membrane-associated system for DNA modification. In 
      Bacteroidetes, subtype VI-B1 systems might degrade nascent transcripts of foreign 
      DNA in conjunction with its uptake by the bacterial cell. These predictions suggest 
      several experimental directions for the study of type VI CRISPR-Cas systems and 
      distinct mechanisms of foreign DNA uptake and degradation in bacteria.

AB  - Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have emerged as versatile master regulator of biological 
      functions in recent years. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous ncRNAs of 18-24 
      nucleotides in length that originates from long self-complementary precursors. 
      Besides their direct involvement in developmental processes, plant miRNAs play key 
      roles in gene regulatory networks and varied biological processes. Alternatively, 
      long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) are a large and diverse class of transcribed ncRNAs whose 
      length exceed that of 200 nucleotides. Plant lncRNAs are transcribed by different 
      RNA polymerases, showing diverse structural features. Plant lncRNAs also are 
      important regulators of gene expression in diverse biological processes. There has 
      been a breakthrough in the technology of genome editing, the CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered 
      regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9) 
      technology, in the last decade. CRISPR loci are transcribed into ncRNA and 
      eventually form a functional complex with Cas9 and further guide the complex to 
      cleave complementary invading DNA. The CRISPR-Cas technology has been successfully 
      applied in model plants such as Arabidopsis and tobacco and important crops like 
      wheat, maize, and rice. However, all these studies are focused on protein coding 
      genes. Information about targeting non-coding genes is scarce. Hitherto, the 
      CRISPR-Cas technology has been exclusively used in vertebrate systems to engineer 
      miRNA/lncRNAs, but it is still relatively unexplored in plants. While briefing 
      miRNAs, lncRNAs and applications of the CRISPR-Cas technology in human and animals, 
      this review essentially elaborates several strategies to overcome the challenges of 
      applying the CRISPR-Cas technology in editing ncRNAs in plants and the future 
      perspective of this field.

      CRISPR/Cas Experiments.

LID - 63
AB  - Computational tools are essential in the process of designing a CRISPR/Cas 
      experiment for the targeted modification of an organism's genome. Among other 
      functionalities, these tools facilitate the design of a guide-RNA (gRNA) for a given 
      nuclease that maximizes its binding to the intended genomic site, while avoiding 
      binding to undesired sites with similar sequences in the genome of the organism of 
      interest (off-targets). Due to the popularity of this methodology and the rapid pace 
      at which it evolves and changes, new computational tools show up constantly. This 
      rapid turnover, together with the intrinsic high death-rate of bioinformatics tools, 
      mean that many of the published tools become unavailable at some point. 
      Consequently, the traditional ways to inform the community about the landscape of 
      available tools, i.e., reviews in the scientific literature, are not adequate for 
      this fast-moving field. To overcome these limitations, we have developed "WeReview: 
      CRISPR Tools," a live, on-line, user-updatable repository of computational tools to 
      assist researchers in designing CRISPR/Cas experiments. In its web site users can 
      find an updated comprehensive list of tools and search for those fulfilling their 
      specific needs, as well as proposing modifications to the data associated with the 
      tools or the incorporation of new ones.

TI  - Virulence of the Pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis Is Controlled by the CRISPR-Cas 
      Protein Cas3.
LID - 10.1128/mSystems.00852-20 [doi]
LID - e00852-20
AB  - The CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat)-Cas system is 
      a unique genomic entity that provides prokaryotic cells with adaptive and heritable 
      immunity. Initial studies identified CRISPRs as central elements used by bacteria to 
      protect against foreign nucleic acids; however, emerging evidence points to CRISPR 
      involvement in bacterial virulence. The present study aimed to identify the 
      participation of one CRISPR-Cas protein, Cas3, in the virulence of the oral pathogen 
      Porphyromonas gingivalis, an organism highly associated with periodontitis. Our 
      results show that compared to the wild type, a mutant with a deletion of the Cas3 
      gene, an essential nuclease part of the class 1 type I CRISPR-Cas system, increased 
      the virulence of P. gingivalis In vitro infection modeling revealed only mildly 
      enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokines by THP-1 cells when infected with 
      the mutant strain. Dual transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of infected 
      THP-1 cells showed an increase in expression of genes associated with pathogenesis 
      in response to Δcas3 mutant infection, with the target of Cas3 activities in 
      neutrophil chemotaxis and gene silencing. The importance of cas3 in controlling 
      virulence was corroborated in a Galleria mellonella infection model, where the 
      presence of the Δcas3 mutant resulted in a statistically significant increase in 
      mortality of G. mellonella A time-series analysis of transcription patterning during 
      infection showed that G. mellonella elicited very different immune responses to the 
      wild-type and the Δcas3 mutant strains and revealed a rearrangement of association 
      in coexpression networks. Together, these observations show for the first time that 
      Cas3 plays a significant role in regulating the virulence of P. gingivalis 
      IMPORTANCE Porphyromonas gingivalis is a key pathogen of periodontitis, a 
      polymicrobial disease characterized by a chronic inflammation that destroys the 
      tissues supporting the teeth. Thus, understanding the virulence potential of P. 
      gingivalis is essential to maintaining a healthy oral microbiome. In nonoral 
      organisms, CRISPR-Cas systems have been shown to modulate a variety of microbial 
      processes, including protection from exogenous nucleic acids, and, more recently, 
      have been implicated in bacterial virulence. Previously, our clinical findings 
      identified activation of the CRISPR-Cas system in patient samples at the transition 
      to disease; however, the mechanism of contribution to disease remained unknown. The 
      importance of the present study resides in that it is becoming increasingly clear 
      that CRISPR-associated proteins have broader functions than initially thought and 
      that those functions now include their role in the virulence of periodontal 
      pathogens. Studying a P. gingivalis cas3 mutant, we demonstrate that at least one of 
      the CRISPR-Cas systems is involved in the regulation of virulence during infection.

AB  - One key advantage of RNA over genomic editing is its temporary effects. Aside from 
      current use of DNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas9, the more recently discovered CRISPR-Cas13 
      has been explored as a means of editing due to its RNA-targeting capabilities. 
      Specifically, there has been a recent interest in identifying and functionally 
      characterizing biochemical RNA modifications, which has spurred a new field of 
      research known as "epitranscriptomics". As one of the most frequently occurring 
      transcriptome modifications, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) has generated much interest. 
      The presence of m6A modifications is under the tight control of a series of 
      regulators, and the ability of fusing these proteins or demethylases to 
      catalytically inactive CRISPR proteins have resulted in a new wave of programmable 
      RNA methylation tools. In addition, studies have been conducted to develop different 
      CRISPR/Cas and base editor systems capable of more efficient editing, and some have 
      explored the effects of in vivo editing for certain diseases. As well, the 
      application of CRISPR and base editors for screening shows promise in revealing the 
      phenotypic outcomes from m6A modification, many of which are linked to 
      physiological, and pathological effects. Thus, the therapeutic potential of 
      CRISPR/Cas and base editors for not only m6A related, but other RNA and DNA related 
      disease has also garnered insight. In this review, we summarize/discuss the recent 
      findings on RNA editing with CRISPR, base editors and non-CRISPR related tools and 
      offer a perspective regarding future applications for basic and clinical research.

AB  - We report the first application of CRISPR-Cas technology to single species detection 
      from environmental DNA (eDNA). Organisms shed and excrete DNA into their environment 
      such as in skin cells and faeces, referred to as environmental DNA (eDNA). Utilising 
      eDNA allows noninvasive monitoring with increased specificity and sensitivity. 
      Current methods primarily employ PCR-based techniques to detect a given species from 
      eDNA samples, posing a logistical challenge for on-site monitoring and potential 
      adaptation to biosensor devices. We have developed an alternative method; coupling 
      isothermal amplification to a CRISPR-Cas12a detection system. This utilises the 
      collateral cleavage activity of Cas12a, a ribonuclease guided by a highly specific 
      single CRISPR RNA. We used the target species Salmo salar as a proof-of-concept test 
      of the specificity of the assay among closely related species and to show the assay 
      is successful at a single temperature of 37°C with signal detection at 535 nM. The 
      specific assay, detects at attomolar sensitivity with rapid detection rates 
      (<2.5 hr). This approach simplifies the challenge of building a biosensor device for 
      rapid target species detection in the field and can be easily adapted to detect any 
      species from eDNA samples from a variety of sources enhancing the capabilities of 
      eDNA as a tool for monitoring biodiversity.

      to discriminate plasmids and phages.

AB  - Bacteria harbour multiple innate defences and adaptive CRISPR-Cas systems that 
      provide immunity against bacteriophages and mobile genetic elements. Although some 
      bacteria modulate defences in response to population density, stress and metabolic 
      state, a lack of high-throughput methods to systematically reveal regulators has 
      hampered efforts to understand when and how immune strategies are deployed. We 
      developed a robust approach called SorTn-seq, which combines saturation transposon 
      mutagenesis, fluorescence-activated cell sorting and deep sequencing to characterize 
      regulatory networks controlling CRISPR-Cas immunity in Serratia sp. ATCC 39006. We 
      applied our technology to assess csm gene expression for ~300,000 mutants and 
      uncovered multiple pathways regulating type III-A CRISPR-Cas expression. Mutation of 
      igaA or mdoG activated the Rcs outer-membrane stress response, eliciting 
      cell-surface-based innate immunity against diverse phages via the transcriptional 
      regulators RcsB and RcsA. Activation of this Rcs phosphorelay concomitantly 
      attenuated adaptive immunity by three distinct type I and III CRISPR-Cas systems. 
      Rcs-mediated repression of CRISPR-Cas defence enabled increased acquisition and 
      retention of plasmids. Dual downregulation of cell-surface receptors and adaptive 
      immunity in response to stress by the Rcs pathway enables protection from phage 
      infection without preventing the uptake of plasmids that may harbour beneficial 
      traits.

AB  - Since December 2019, we have been in the battlefield with a new threat to the 
      humanity known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In 
      this review, we describe the four main methods used for diagnosis, screening and/or 
      surveillance of SARS-CoV-2: Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain 
      reaction (RT-PCR); chest computed tomography (CT); and different complementary 
      alternatives developed in order to obtain rapid results, antigen and antibody 
      detection. All of them compare the highlighting advantages and disadvantages from an 
      analytical point of view. The gold standard method in terms of sensitivity and 
      specificity is the RT-PCR. The different modifications propose to make it more rapid 
      and applicable at point of care (POC) are also presented and discussed. CT images 
      are limited to central hospitals. However, being combined with RT-PCR is the most 
      robust and accurate way to confirm COVID-19 infection. Antibody tests, although 
      unable to provide reliable results on the status of the infection, are suitable for 
      carrying out maximum screening of the population in order to know the immune 
      capacity. More recently, antigen tests, less sensitive than RT-PCR, have been 
      authorized to determine in a quicker way whether the patient is infected at the time 
      of analysis and without the need of specific instruments.

AB  - Cyanobacteria are a group of photosynthetic microorganisms with high commercial 
      potential. They can utilize sunlight directly to convert carbon dioxide or even 
      nitrogen into a variety of industrially relevant chemicals. However, commercial 
      platforms for the renewable and sustainable production of chemicals have yet to be 
      demonstrated for cyanobacteria. Diverse strategies have therefore been employed in 
      recent years to improve the production yields and efficiency of target chemicals. 
      These include the use of CRISPR/Cas systems for mutant selection, synthetic RNA 
      elements for controlling transcription, metabolic network modelling for 
      understanding pathway fluxes, enzyme engineering, improving growth rates, 
      alleviating product toxicity and microbial consortia. More elaborate strategies for 
      engineering cyanobacteria, however, are still very much required if we are to meet 
      the grand challenge of employing cyanobacteria as photosynthetic workhorses for 
      large-scale industrial applications.

AB  - The genome-wide perturbation of transcriptional networks with CRISPR-Cas technology 
      has primarily involved systematic and targeted gene modulation. Here, we developed 
      PRISM (Perturbing Regulatory Interactions by Synthetic Modulators), a screening 
      platform that uses randomized CRISPR-Cas transcription factors (crisprTFs) to 
      globally perturb transcriptional networks. By applying PRISM to a yeast model of 
      Parkinson's disease (PD), we identified guide RNAs (gRNAs) that modulate 
      transcriptional networks and protect cells from alpha-synuclein (αSyn) toxicity. One 
      gRNA identified in this screen outperformed the most protective suppressors of αSyn 
      toxicity reported previously, highlighting PRISM's ability to identify modulators of 
      important phenotypes. Gene expression profiling revealed genes differentially 
      modulated by this strong protective gRNA that rescued yeast from αSyn toxicity when 
      overexpressed. Human homologs of top-ranked hits protected against αSyn-induced cell 
      death in a human neuronal PD model. Thus, high-throughput and unbiased perturbation 
      of transcriptional networks via randomized crisprTFs can reveal complex biological 
      phenotypes and effective disease modulators.

AB  - CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic 
      repeats/CRISPR-associated protein)-mediated genome editing has revolutionized 
      fundamental research and plant breeding. Beyond gene editing, CRISPR/Cas systems 
      have been repurposed as a platform for programmable transcriptional regulation. 
      Catalytically inactive Cas variants (dCas), when fused with transcriptional 
      activation domains, allow for specific activation of any target gene in the genome 
      without inducing DNA double-strand breaks. CRISPR activation enables simultaneous 
      activation of multiple genes, holding great promise in the identification of gene 
      regulatory networks and rewiring of metabolic pathways. Here, we describe a simple 
      protocol for constructing a dCas9-mediated multiplexed gene activation system based 
      on the CRISPR-Act3.0 system. The resulting vectors are tested in rice protoplasts. ©

AB  - Targeted endogenous gene activation is necessary for understanding complex gene 
      networks and has great potential in medical and industrial applications. The 
      CRISPR-Cas system offers simple and powerful tools for this purpose. However, these 
      CRISPR-Cas-based tools for activating user-defined genes are unable to offer precise 
      temporal control of gene expression, despite the fact that many biological phenomena 
      are regulated by highly dynamic patterns of gene expression. Here we created a 
      light-inducible, user-defined, endogenous gene activation system based on 
      CRISPR-Cas9. We demonstrated that this CRISPR-Cas9-based transcription system can 
      allow rapid and reversible targeted gene activation by light. In addition, using 
      this system, we have exemplified photoactivation of multiple user-defined endogenous 
      genes in mammalian cells. The present CRISPR-Cas9-based transcription system offers 
      simple and versatile approaches for precise endogenous gene activation in basic 
      biological research and biotechnology applications.

TI  - Comparative network clustering of direct repeats (DRs) and cas genes confirms the 
      possibility of the horizontal transfer of CRISPR locus among bacteria.

AB  - CRISPRs are a diverse family of DNA repeat sequences that are widely distributed 
      among archaea and bacteria. The CRISPR locus is usually composed of three key 
      elements; direct repeats (DRs), spacer sequences and the cas genes. Although recent 
      studies have suggested that spacers may be of extrachromosomal origin, the 
      evolutionary origin of the other two elements of the CRISPR locus has remained 
      unresolved. With the aim to elucidate the evolutionary origin and association of DRs 
      and cas genes of the CRISPR locus, a comparative analysis of the evolutionary 
      network clusters of DRs, cas1 and 16S rRNA genes sequences from 100 different 
      bacteria was conducted. Significant matches of DR and cas1 gene clades imply that 
      these CRISPR components are evolutionary closely linked and potentially evolving 
      simultaneously as a whole locus. On the contrary, the prominent discordance between 
      the CASS (DR and cas1) clades and the 16S rRNA clusters indicates that CRISPR locus 
      has been transferred horizontally as a complete package. Sequence analysis also 
      revealed that DR and cas1 genes are coevolving under analogous evolutionary 
      pressure. This atypical evolutionary pattern also signifies the possibility of 
      horizontal transfer event of CRISPR locus.

AB  - Cellular RNA is decorated with over 170 types of chemical modifications. Many 
      modifications in mRNA, including m(6) A and m(5) C, have been associated with 
      critical cellular functions under physiological and/or pathological conditions. To 
      understand the biological functions of these modifications, it is vital to identify 
      the regulators that modulate the modification rate. However, a high-throughput 
      method for unbiased screening of these regulators is so far lacking. Here, we report 
      such a method combining pooled CRISPR screen and reporters with RNA modification 
      readout, termed CRISPR integrated gRNA and reporter sequencing (CIGAR-seq). Using 
      CIGAR-seq, we discovered NSUN6 as a novel mRNA m(5) C methyltransferase. Subsequent 
      mRNA bisulfite sequencing in HAP1 cells without or with NSUN6 and/or NSUN2 knockout 
      showed that NSUN6 and NSUN2 worked on non-overlapping subsets of mRNA m(5) C sites 
      and together contributed to almost all the m(5) C modification in mRNA. Finally, 
      using m(1) A as an example, we demonstrated that CIGAR-seq can be easily adapted for 
      identifying regulators of other mRNA modification.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many fungi grow as saprobic organisms and obtain nutrients from a wide 
      range of dead organic materials. Among saprobes, fungal species that grow on wood or 
      in polluted environments have evolved prolific mechanisms for the production of 
      degrading compounds, such as ligninolytic enzymes. These enzymes include arrays of 
      intense redox-potential oxidoreductase, such as laccase, catalase, and peroxidases. 
      The ability to produce ligninolytic enzymes makes a variety of fungal species 
      suitable for application in many industries, including the production of biofuels 
      and antibiotics, bioremediation, and biomedical application as biosensors. However, 
      fungal ligninolytic enzymes are produced naturally in small quantities that may not 
      meet the industrial or market demands. Over the last decade, combined synthetic 
      biology and computational designs have yielded significant results in enhancing the 
      synthesis of natural compounds in fungi. In this review, we gave insights into 
      different protein engineering methods, including rational, semi-rational, and 
      directed evolution approaches that have been employed to enhance the production of 
      some important ligninolytic enzymes in fungi. We described the role of metabolic 
      pathway engineering to optimize the synthesis of chemical compounds of interest in 
      various fields. We highlighted synthetic biology novel techniques for biosynthetic 
      gene cluster (BGC) activation in fungo and heterologous reconstruction of BGC in 
      microbial cells. We also discussed in detail some recombinant ligninolytic enzymes 
      that have been successfully enhanced and expressed in different heterologous hosts. 
      Finally, we described recent advance in CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced 
      Short Palindromic Repeats)-Cas (CRISPR associated) protein systems as the most 
      promising biotechnology for large-scale production of ligninolytic enzymes. SHORT 
      CONCLUSION: Aggregation, expression, and regulation of ligninolytic enzymes in fungi 
      require very complex procedures with many interfering factors. Synthetic and 
      computational biology strategies, as explained in this review, are powerful tools 
      that can be combined to solve these puzzles. These integrated strategies can lead to 
      the production of enzymes with special abilities, such as wide substrate 
      specifications, thermo-stability, tolerance to long time storage, and stability in 
      different substrate conditions, such as pH and nutrients.

AB  - Genetic manipulation of microorganisms has been crucial in understanding their 
      biology, yet for many microbial species, robust tools for comprehensive genetic 
      analysis were lacking until the advent of CRISPR-Cas-based gene editing techniques. 
      In this Progress article, we discuss advances in CRISPR-based techniques for the 
      genetic analysis of genetically intractable microorganisms, with an emphasis on 
      mycobacteria, fungi and parasites. We discuss how CRISPR-based analyses in these 
      organisms have enabled the discovery of novel gene functions, the investigation of 
      genetic interaction networks and the identification of virulence factors.

AB  - The study of transcriptional regulation of tomato ripening has been led by 
      spontaneous mutations in transcription factor (TF) genes that completely inhibit 
      normal ripening, suggesting that they are 'master regulators'. Studies using 
      CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis to produce knockouts of the underlying genes indicate a 
      different picture, suggesting that the regulation is more robust than previously 
      thought. This requires us to revisit our model of the regulation of ripening and 
      replace it with one involving a network of partially redundant components. At the 
      same time, the fast rise of CRISPR/Cas mutagenesis, resulting in unexpectedly weak 
      phenotypes, compared with knockdown technology, suggests that compensatory 
      mechanisms may obscure protein functions. This emphasises the need for assessment of 
      these mechanisms in plants and for the careful design of mutagenesis experiments.

TI  - A revolutionary tool: CRISPR technology plays an important role in construction of 
      intelligentized gene circuits.

AB  - With the development of synthetic biology, synthetic gene circuits have shown great 
      applied potential in medicine, biology, and as commodity chemicals. An ultimate 
      challenge in the construction of gene circuits is the lack of effective, 
      programmable, secure and sequence-specific gene editing tools. The clustered 
      regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) system, a CRISPR-associated 
      RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9)-targeted genome editing 
      tool, has recently been applied in engineering gene circuits for its unique 
      properties-operability, high efficiency and programmability. The traditional 
      single-targeted therapy cannot effectively distinguish tumour cells from normal 
      cells, and gene therapy for single targets has poor anti-tumour effects, which 
      severely limits the application of gene therapy. Currently, the design of gene 
      circuits using tumour-specific targets based on CRISPR/Cas systems provides a new 
      way for precision cancer therapy. Hence, the application of intelligentized gene 
      circuits based on CRISPR technology effectively guarantees the safety, efficiency 
      and specificity of cancer therapy. Here, we assessed the use of synthetic gene 
      circuits and if the CRISPR system could be used, especially artificial 
      switch-inducible Cas9, to more effectively target and treat tumour cells. Moreover, 
      we also discussed recent advances, prospectives and underlying challenges in 
      CRISPR-based gene circuit development.

AB  - Dissecting the complex network of epigenetic modifications requires tools that 
      combine precise recognition of DNA sequences with the capability to modify 
      epigenetic marks. The CRISPR/Cas system has been proven to be a valuable addition to 
      existing methodologies that fulfill these tasks. So far, sequence-specific editing 
      of epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone posttranslational 
      modifications relied on direct fusions of enzymatically inactivated Cas9 (dCas9) 
      with epigenetic effectors. Here, we report a novel, modular system that facilitates 
      the recruitment of any GFP-tagged protein to desired genomic loci. By fusing dCas9 
      to a GFP-binding nanobody (GBP) we demonstrate that prevalent epigenetic 
      modifications at mouse major satellite repeats can be erased or set de novo by 
      recruiting GFP-coupled catalytic domains of TET1 and DNMT3A, respectively. 
      Furthermore, we construct an inducible expression system that enables a temporally 
      controlled expression of both GBP-dCas9 and the effector protein. Thus, our approach 
      further expands the CRISPR/Cas toolbox for site-specific manipulation of epigenetic 
      modifications with a modular and easy-to-use system.

      essential for low-noise gene network and dynamic range of gene expression. However, 
      such manipulations have been hard to achieve due to technical limitations. Based on 
      tandem promoters and CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic 
      repeats)/Cas (CRISPR-associated) system, we constructed a multistage regulator that 
      could stably regulate the expression of the reporter gene on three levels, with more 
      than 2-fold difference between each of them. Our findings provide novel insights 
      into constructing a more powerful gene regulation system.

AB  - Since the breakthrough discoveries that CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases can be easily 
      programmed and employed to induce targeted double-strand breaks in mammalian cells, 
      the gene editing field has grown exponentially. Today, CRISPR technologies based on 
      engineered class II CRISPR effectors facilitate targeted modification of genes and 
      RNA transcripts. Moreover, catalytically impaired CRISPR-Cas variants can be 
      employed as programmable DNA binding domains and used to recruit effector proteins, 
      such as transcriptional regulators, epigenetic modifiers or base-modifying enzymes, 
      to selected genomic loci. The juxtaposition of CRISPR and optogenetics enables 
      spatiotemporally confined and highly dynamic genome perturbations in living cells 
      and animals and holds unprecedented potential for biology and biomedicine.Here, we 
      provide an overview of the state-of-the-art methods for light-control of CRISPR 
      effectors. We will detail the plethora of exciting applications enabled by these 
      systems, including spatially confined genome editing, timed activation of endogenous 
      genes, as well as remote control of chromatin-chromatin interactions. Finally, we 
      will discuss limitations of current optogenetic CRISPR tools and point out routes 
      for future innovation in this emerging field.

AB  - In addition to their roles as revolutionary genome engineering tools, CRISPR-Cas 
      systems are also highly promising candidates in the construction of biosensing 
      systems and diagnostic devices, which have attracted significant attention recently. 
      However, the CRISPR-Cas system cannot be directly applied in the sensing of 
      non-nucleic acid targets, and the needs of synthesizing and storing different 
      vulnerable guide RNA for different targets also increase the application and storage 
      costs of relevant biosensing systems, and therefore restrict their widespread 
      applications. To tackle these barriers, in this work, a versatile 
      CRISPR-Cas12a-based biosensing platform was developed through the introduction of an 
      enzyme-free and robust DNA reaction network, the entropy-driven dynamic DNA network. 
      By programming the sequences of the system, the entropy-driven catalysis-based 
      dynamic DNA network can respond to different types of targets, such as nucleic acids 
      or proteins, and then activate the CRISPR-Cas12a to generate amplified signals. As a 
      proof of concept, both nucleic acid targets (a DNA target with random sequence, T, 
      and an RNA target, microRNA-21 (miR-21)) and a non-nucleic acid target (a protein 
      target, thrombin) were chosen as model analytes to address the feasibility of the 
      designed sensing platform, with detection limits at the pM level for the nucleic 
      acid analytes (7.4 pM for the DNA target T and 25.5 pM for miR-21) and 0.4 nM for 
      thrombin. In addition, the detection of miR-21 or thrombin in human serum samples 
      further demonstrated the applicability of the proposed biosensing platform in real 
      sample analysis.

AB  - One of the key drivers for successful metabolic engineering in microbes is the 
      efficacy by which genomes can be edited. As such there are many methods to choose 
      from when aiming to modify genomes, especially those of model organisms like yeast 
      and bacteria. In recent years, clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats 
      (CRISPR) and its associated proteins (Cas) have become the method of choice for 
      precision genome engineering in many organisms due to their orthogonality, 
      versatility and efficacy. Here we review the strategies adopted for implementation 
      of RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing with special emphasis on their application 
      for metabolic engineering of yeast and bacteria. Also, examples of how 
      nuclease-deficient Cas9 has been applied for RNA-guided transcriptional regulation 
      of target genes will be reviewed, as well as tools available for computer-aided 
      design of guide-RNAs will be highlighted. Finally, this review will provide a 
      perspective on the immediate challenges and opportunities foreseen by the use of 
      CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering and regulation in the context of metabolic 
      engineering.

AB  - Synthetic biology has the potential to provide decisive advances in genetic control 
      of metabolic pathways. However, there are several challenges that synthetic 
      biologists must overcome before this vision becomes a reality. First, a library of 
      diverse and well-characterized sensors, such as metabolite-sensing or 
      condition-sensing promoters, must be constructed. Second, robust programmable 
      circuits that link input conditions with a specific gene regulation response must be 
      developed. Finally, multi-gene targeting strategies must be integrated with 
      metabolically relevant sensors and complex, robust logic. Achievements in each of 
      these areas, which employ the CRISPR/Cas system, in silico modeling, and dynamic 
      sensor-regulators, among other tools, provide a strong basis for future research. 
      Overall, the future for synthetic biology approaches in metabolic engineering holds 
      immense promise.

AB  - Cancer immunotherapy has gained attention as the supreme therapeutic modality for 
      the treatment of various malignancies. Adoptive T-cell therapy (ACT) is one of the 
      most distinctive modalities of this therapeutic approach, which seeks to harness the 
      potential of combating cancer cells by using autologous or allogenic tumor-specific 
      T-cells. However, a plethora of circumstances must be optimized to produce 
      functional, durable, and efficient T-cells. Recently, the potential of ACT has been 
      further realized by the introduction of novel gene-editing platforms such as the 
      CRISPR/Cas9 system; this technique has been utilized to create T-cells furnished 
      with recombinant T-cell receptor (TCR) or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that have 
      precise tumor antigen recognition, minimal side effects and treatment-related 
      toxicities, robust proliferation and cytotoxicity, and nominal exhaustion. Here, we 
      aim to review and categorize the recent breakthroughs of genetically modified 
      TCR/CAR T-cells through CRISPR/Cas9 technology and address the pearls and pitfalls 
      of each method. In addition, we investigate the latest ongoing clinical trials that 
      are applying CRISPR-associated TCR/CAR T-cells for the treatment of cancers.

AB  - CRISPR-associated protein 1 (Cas1) is a universally conserved essential 
      metalloenzyme of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat 
      (CRISPR) immune system of prokaryotes (bacteria, archaea) that can cut and integrate 
      a part of viral DNA to its host genome with the help of other proteins. The 
      integrated DNA acts as a memory of viral infection, which can be transcribed to RNA 
      and stop future infection by recognition (based on the RNA/DNA complementarity 
      principle) followed by protein-mediated degradation of the viral DNA. It has been 
      proposed that the presence of a single manganese (Mn(2+)) ion in a conserved 
      divalent-metal-ion binding pocket (key residues: E190, H254, D265, D268) of Cas1 is 
      crucial for its function. Cas1-mediated DNA degradation was proposed to be hindered 
      by metal substitution, metal chelation, or mutation of the binding pocket residues. 
      Cas1 is active toward dsDNA degradation with both Mn(2+) and Mg(2+). X-ray 
      structures of Cas1 revealed an intricate atomic interaction network of the 
      divalent-metal-ion binding pocket and opened up the possibility of modeling related 
      metal ions (viz., Mg(2+), Ca(2+)) in the binding pocket of wild-type (WT) and 
      mutated Cas1 proteins for computational analysis, which includes (1) quantitative 
      estimation of the energetics of the divalent-metal-ion preference and (2) exploring 
      the structural and dynamical aspects of the protein in response to 
      divalent-metal-ion substitution or amino acid mutation. Using the X-ray structure of 
      the Cas1 protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a template (PDB 3GOD), we performed 
      (∼2.23 μs) classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to compare structural and 
      dynamical differences between Mg(2+)- and Ca(2+)-bound binding pockets of wild-type 
      (WT) and mutant (E190A, H254A, D265A, D268A) Cas1. Furthermore, reduced binding 
      pocket models were generated from X-ray and molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories, 
      and the resulting structures were subjected to quantum chemical calculations. 
      Results suggest that Cas1 prefers Mg(2+) binding relative to Ca(2+) and the 
      preference is the strongest for WT and the weakest for the D268A mutant. Quantum 
      chemical calculations indicate that Mn(2+) is the most preferred relative to both 
      Mg(2+) and Ca(2+) in the wild-type and mutant Cas1. Substitution of Mg(2+) by Ca(2+) 
      does not alter the interaction network between Cas1 and the divalent metal ion but 
      increases the wetness of the binding pocket by introducing a single water molecule 
      in the first coordination shell of the latter. The strength of metal-ion preference 
      (Mg(2+) versus Ca(2+)) seems to be dependent on the solvent accessibility of the 
      divalent-metal-ion binding pocket, strongest for wild-type Cas1 (in which the 
      metal-ion binding pocket is dry, which includes two water molecules) and the weakest 
      for the D268A mutant (in which the metal-ion binding pocket is wet, which includes 
      four water molecules).

AB  - Bioremediation is the degradation potential of microorganisms to dissimilate the 
      complex chemical compounds from the surrounding environment. The genetics and 
      biochemistry of biodegradation processes in datasets opened the way of systems 
      biology. Systemic biology aid the study of interacting parts involved in the system. 
      The significant keys of system biology are biodegradation network, computational 
      biology, and omics approaches. Biodegradation network consists of all the databases 
      and datasets which aid in assisting the degradation and deterioration potential of 
      microorganisms for bioremediation processes. This review deciphers the 
      bio-degradation network, i.e., the databases and datasets (UM-BBD, PAN, PTID, etc.) 
      aiding in assisting the degradation and deterioration potential of microorganisms 
      for bioremediation processes, computational biology and multi omics approaches like 
      metagenomics, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics for the 
      efficient functional gene mining and their validation for bioremediation 
      experiments. Besides, the present review also describes the gene editing tools like 
      CRISPR Cas, TALEN, and ZFNs which can possibly make design microbe with functional 
      gene of interest for degradation of particular recalcitrant for improved 
      bioremediation.

AB  - DNA nanotechnology, and DNA computing in particular, has grown extensively over the 
      past decade to end with a variety of functional stable structures and dynamic 
      circuits. However, the use as designer elements of regular DNA pieces, perfectly 
      complementary double strands, has remained elusive. Here, we report the exploitation 
      of CRISPR-Cas systems to engineer logic circuits based on isothermal strand 
      displacement that perform with toehold-free double-stranded DNA. We designed and 
      implemented molecular converters for signal detection and amplification, showing 
      good interoperability between enzymatic and nonenzymatic processes. Overall, these 
      results contribute to enlarge the repertoire of substrates and reactions (hardware) 
      for DNA computing.

AB  - Repurposed CRISPR-Cas molecules provide a useful tool set for broad applications of 
      genomic editing and regulation of gene expression in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. 
      Recent discovery of phage-derived proteins, anti-CRISPRs, which serve to abrogate 
      natural CRISPR anti-phage activity, potentially expands the ability to build 
      synthetic CRISPR-mediated circuits. Here, we characterize a panel of anti-CRISPR 
      molecules for expanded applications to counteract CRISPR-mediated gene activation 
      and repression of reporter and endogenous genes in various cell types. We 
      demonstrate that cells pre-engineered with anti-CRISPR molecules become resistant to 
      gene editing, thus providing a means to generate "write-protected" cells that 
      prevent future gene editing. We further show that anti-CRISPRs can be used to 
      control CRISPR-based gene regulation circuits, including implementation of a pulse 
      generator circuit in mammalian cells. Our work suggests that anti-CRISPR proteins 
      should serve as widely applicable tools for synthetic systems regulating the 
      behavior of eukaryotic cells.

TI  - A CRISPR-Assisted Nonhomologous End-Joining Strategy for Efficient Genome Editing in 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
LID - 10.1128/mBio.02364-19 [doi]
LID - e02364-19
AB  - New tools for genetic manipulation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are needed for the 
      development of new drug regimens and vaccines aimed at curing tuberculosis 
      infections. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat 
      (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) systems generate a highly specific 
      double-strand break at the target site that can be repaired via nonhomologous end 
      joining (NHEJ), resulting in the desired genome alteration. In this study, we first 
      improved the NHEJ repair pathway and developed a CRISPR-Cas-mediated genome-editing 
      method that allowed us to generate markerless deletion in Mycobacterium smegmatis, 
      Mycobacterium marinum, and M. tuberculosis Then, we demonstrated that this system 
      could efficiently achieve simultaneous generation of double mutations and 
      large-scale genetic mutations in M. tuberculosis Finally, we showed that the 
      strategy we developed can also be used to facilitate genome editing in Escherichia 
      coli IMPORTANCE The global health impact of M. tuberculosis necessitates the 
      development of new genetic tools for its manipulation, to facilitate the 
      identification and characterization of novel drug targets and vaccine candidates. 
      Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated 
      protein (Cas) genome editing has proven to be a powerful genetic tool in various 
      organisms; to date, however, attempts to use this approach in M. tuberculosis have 
      failed. Here, we describe a genome-editing tool based on CRISPR cleavage and the 
      nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair pathway that can efficiently generate 
      deletion mutants in M. tuberculosis More importantly, this system can generate 
      simultaneous double mutations and large-scale genetic mutations in this species. We 
      anticipate that this CRISPR-NHEJ-assisted genome-editing system will be broadly 
      useful for research on mycobacteria, vaccine development, and drug target profiling.

AB  - Genetic circuits require many regulatory parts in order to implement signal 
      processing or execute algorithms in cells. A potentially scalable approach is to use 
      dCas9, which employs small guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to repress genetic loci via the 
      programmability of RNA:DNA base pairing. To this end, we use dCas9 and designed 
      sgRNAs to build transcriptional logic gates and connect them to perform computation 
      in living cells. We constructed a set of NOT gates by designing five synthetic 
      Escherichia coli σ70 promoters that are repressed by corresponding sgRNAs, and these 
      interactions do not exhibit crosstalk between each other. These sgRNAs exhibit high 
      on-target repression (56- to 440-fold) and negligible off-target interactions (< 
      1.3-fold). These gates were connected to build larger circuits, including the 
      Boolean-complete NOR gate and a 3-gate circuit consisting of four layered sgRNAs. 
      The synthetic circuits were connected to the native E. coli regulatory network by 
      designing output sgRNAs to target an E. coli transcription factor (malT). This 
      converts the output of a synthetic circuit to a switch in cellular phenotype (sugar 
      utilization, chemotaxis, phage resistance).

TI  - Does co-transcriptional regulation of alternative splicing mediate plant stress 
      responses?
PG  - 2716-2726
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkz121 [doi]
AB  - Plants display exquisite control over gene expression to elicit appropriate 
      responses under normal and stress conditions. Alternative splicing (AS) of 
      pre-mRNAs, a process that generates two or more transcripts from multi-exon genes, 
      adds another layer of regulation to fine-tune condition-specific gene expression in 
      animals and plants. However, exactly how plants control splice isoform ratios and 
      the timing of this regulation in response to environmental signals remains elusive. 
      In mammals, recent evidence indicate that epigenetic and epitranscriptome changes, 
      such as DNA methylation, chromatin modifications and RNA methylation, regulate RNA 
      polymerase II processivity, co-transcriptional splicing, and stability and 
      translation efficiency of splice isoforms. In plants, the role of epigenetic 
      modifications in regulating transcription rate and mRNA abundance under stress is 
      beginning to emerge. However, the mechanisms by which epigenetic and 
      epitranscriptomic modifications regulate AS and translation efficiency require 
      further research. Dynamic changes in the chromatin landscape in response to stress 
      may provide a scaffold around which gene expression, AS and translation are 
      orchestrated. Finally, we discuss CRISPR/Cas-based strategies for engineering 
      chromatin architecture to manipulate AS patterns (or splice isoforms levels) to 
      obtain insight into the epigenetic regulation of AS.

TI  - Minimized combinatorial CRISPR screens identify genetic interactions in autophagy.
PG  - 5684-5704
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkab309 [doi]
AB  - Combinatorial CRISPR-Cas screens have advanced the mapping of genetic interactions, 
      but their experimental scale limits the number of targetable gene combinations. 
      Here, we describe 3Cs multiplexing, a rapid and scalable method to generate highly 
      diverse and uniformly distributed combinatorial CRISPR libraries. We demonstrate 
      that the library distribution skew is the critical determinant of its required 
      screening coverage. By circumventing iterative cloning of PCR-amplified 
      oligonucleotides, 3Cs multiplexing facilitates the generation of combinatorial 
      CRISPR libraries with low distribution skews. We show that combinatorial 3Cs 
      libraries can be screened with minimal coverages, reducing associated efforts and 
      costs at least 10-fold. We apply a 3Cs multiplexing library targeting 12,736 
      autophagy gene combinations with 247,032 paired gRNAs in viability and 
      reporter-based enrichment screens. In the viability screen, we identify, among 
      others, the synthetic lethal WDR45B-PIK3R4 and the proliferation-enhancing 
      ATG7-KEAP1 genetic interactions. In the reporter-based screen, we identify over 
      1,570 essential genetic interactions for autophagy flux, including interactions 
      among paralogous genes, namely ATG2A-ATG2B, GABARAP-MAP1LC3B and GABARAP-GABARAPL2. 
      However, we only observe few genetic interactions within paralogous gene families of 
      more than two members, indicating functional compensation between them. This work 
      establishes 3Cs multiplexing as a platform for genetic interaction screens at scale.

      Metabolism to Genome Engineering.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18105228 [doi]
LID - 5228
AB  - Extremophiles are microorganisms that populate habitats considered inhospitable from 
      an anthropocentric point of view and are able to tolerate harsh conditions such as 
      high temperatures, extreme pHs, high concentrations of salts, toxic organic 
      substances, and/or heavy metals. These microorganisms have been broadly studied in 
      the last 30 years and represent precious sources of biomolecules and bioprocesses 
      for many biotechnological applications; in this context, scientific efforts have 
      been focused on the employment of extremophilic microbes and their metabolic 
      pathways to develop biomonitoring and bioremediation strategies to face 
      environmental pollution, as well as to improve biorefineries for the conversion of 
      biomasses into various chemical compounds. This review gives an overview on the 
      peculiar metabolic features of certain extremophilic microorganisms, with a main 
      focus on thermophiles, which make them attractive for biotechnological applications 
      in the field of environmental remediation; moreover, it sheds light on updated 
      genetic systems (also those based on the CRISPR-Cas tool), which expand the 
      potentialities of these microorganisms to be genetically manipulated for various 
      biotechnological purposes.

TI  - Integrated mobile genetic elements in Thaumarchaeota.
PG  - 2056-2078
LID - 10.1111/1462-2920.14564 [doi]
AB  - To explore the diversity of mobile genetic elements (MGE) associated with archaea of 
      the phylum Thaumarchaeota, we exploited the property of most MGE to integrate into 
      the genomes of their hosts. Integrated MGE (iMGE) were identified in 20 
      thaumarchaeal genomes amounting to 2 Mbp of mobile thaumarchaeal DNA. These iMGE 
      group into five major classes: (i) proviruses, (ii) casposons, (iii) insertion 
      sequence-like transposons, (iv) integrative-conjugative elements and (v) cryptic 
      integrated elements. The majority of the iMGE belong to the latter category and 
      might represent novel families of viruses or plasmids. The identified proviruses are 
      related to tailed viruses of the order Caudovirales and to tailless icosahedral 
      viruses with the double jelly-roll capsid proteins. The thaumarchaeal iMGE are all 
      connected within a gene sharing network, highlighting pervasive gene exchange 
      between MGE occupying the same ecological niche. The thaumarchaeal mobilome carries 
      multiple auxiliary metabolic genes, including multicopper oxidases and ammonia 
      monooxygenase subunit C (AmoC), and stress response genes, such as those for 
      universal stress response proteins (UspA). Thus, iMGE might make important 
      contributions to the fitness and adaptation of their hosts. We identified several 
      iMGE carrying type I-B CRISPR-Cas systems and spacers matching other thaumarchaeal 
      iMGE, suggesting antagonistic interactions between coexisting MGE and symbiotic 
      relationships with the ir archaeal hosts.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Persistent high-risk human papillomavirus infection is the main cause 
      of various types of cancer especially cervical cancer. The E6 and E7 oncoproteins of 
      HPV play critical roles in promoting carcinogenesis and cancer cell growth. As a 
      result, E6 and E7 oncogenes are considered as promising therapeutic targets for 
      cervical cancer. Recently, the development of genome-editing technologies including 
      transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN), meganucleases (MNs), zinc 
      finger nucleases (ZFN), and more importantly clustered regularly interspaced short 
      palindromic repeat-CRISPR-associated protein (CRISPR-Cas) has sparked a revolution 
      in the cervical cancer-targeted therapy. However, due to immunogenicity, off-target 
      effect, renal clearance, guide RNA (gRNA) nuclease degradation, and difficult direct 
      transportation into the cytoplasm and nucleus, the safe and effective delivery is 
      considered as the Achilles' heel of this robust strategy. AREAS COVERED: In this 
      review, we discuss cutting-edge available strategies for in vivo delivery of 
      genome-editing technologies for HPV-induced cervical cancer therapy. Moreover, the 
      combination of genome-editing tools and other therapies has been fully discussed. 
      EXPERT OPINION: The combination of nanoparticle-based delivery systems and 
      genome-editing tools is a promising powerful strategy for cervical cancer therapy. 
      The most significant limitations of this strategy that need to be focused on are low 
      efficiency and off-target events.

AB  - Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and 
      CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins provide microbial adaptive immunity against 
      invading foreign nucleic acids. In type II-A CRISPR-Cas systems, the Cas1-Cas2 
      integrase complex and the subtype-specific Csn2 comprise the CRISPR adaptation 
      module, which cooperates with the Cas9 nuclease effector for spacer selection. Here, 
      we report the molecular organization of the Streptococcus pyogenes type II-A CRISPR 
      adaptation module and its interaction with Cas9 via Csn2. We determined the crystal 
      structure of S. pyogenes type II-A Cas2. Chromatographic and calorimetric analyses 
      revealed the stoichiometry and topology of the type II-A adaptation module composed 
      of Cas1, Cas2 and Csn2. We also demonstrated that Cas9 interacts with Csn2 in a 
      direct and stoichiometric manner. Our results reveal a network of molecular 
      interactions among type II-A Cas proteins and highlight the role of Csn2 in 
      coordinating Cas components involved in the adaptation and interference stages of 
      CRISPR-mediated immunity.

AB  - The limited target specificity of CRISPR-Cas nucleases poses a challenge with 
      respect to their application in research and therapy. Here, we present a simple and 
      original strategy to enhance the specificity of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing by 
      coupling Cas9 to artificial inhibitory domains. Applying a combination of 
      mathematical modeling and experiments, we first determined how CRISPR-Cas9 activity 
      profiles relate to Cas9 specificity. We then used artificially weakened anti-CRISPR 
      (Acr) proteins either coexpressed with or directly fused to Cas9 to fine-tune its 
      activity toward selected levels, thereby achieving an effective kinetic insulation 
      of ON- and OFF-target editing events. We demonstrate highly specific genome editing 
      in mammalian cells using diverse single-guide RNAs prone to potent OFF-targeting. 
      Last, we show that our strategy is compatible with different modes of delivery, 
      including transient transfection and adeno-associated viral vectors. Together, we 
      provide a highly versatile approach to reduce CRISPR-Cas OFF-target effects via 
      kinetic insulation.

PG  - 171-230
LID - 10.1007/978-3-319-49674-0_7 [doi]
AB  - Cytoplasmic intermediate filaments (IFs) represent a major cytoskeletal network 
      contributing to cell shape, adhesion and migration as well as to tissue resilience 
      and renewal in numerous bilaterians, including mammals. The observation that IFs are 
      dispensable in cultured mammalian cells, but cause tissue-specific, life-threatening 
      disorders, has pushed the need to investigate their function in vivo. In keeping 
      with human disease, the deletion or mutation of murine IF genes resulted in highly 
      specific pathologies. Epidermal keratins, together with desmin, are essential to 
      protect corresponding tissues against mechanical force but also participate in 
      stabilizing cell adhesion and in inflammatory signalling. Surprisingly, other IF 
      proteins contribute to tissue integrity to a much lesser extent than anticipated, 
      pointing towards their role in stress situations. In support, the overexpression of 
      small chaperones or the interference with inflammatory signalling in several 
      settings has been shown to rescue severe tissue pathologies that resulted from the 
      expression of mutant IF proteins. It stills remains an open issue whether the wide 
      range of IF disorders share similar pathomechanisms. Moreover, we lack an 
      understanding how IF proteins participate in signalling processes. Now, with a large 
      number of mouse models in hand, the next challenge will be to develop organotypic 
      cell culture models to dissect pathomechanisms at the molecular level, to employ 
      Crispr/Cas-mediated genome engineering to optimize models and, finally, to combine 
      available animal models with medicinal chemistry for the development of molecular 
      therapies.

TI  - Iron Regulation in Clostridioides difficile.
PG  - 3183
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2018.03183 [doi]
LID - 3183
AB  - The response to iron limitation of several bacteria is regulated by the ferric 
      uptake regulator (Fur). The Fur-regulated transcriptional, translational and 
      metabolic networks of the Gram-positive, pathogen Clostridioides difficile were 
      investigated by a combined RNA sequencing, proteomic, metabolomic and electron 
      microscopy approach. At high iron conditions (15 μM) the C. difficile fur mutant 
      displayed a growth deficiency compared to wild type C. difficile cells. Several iron 
      and siderophore transporter genes were induced by Fur during low iron (0.2 μM) 
      conditions. The major adaptation to low iron conditions was observed for the central 
      energy metabolism. Most ferredoxin-dependent amino acid fermentations were 
      significantly down regulated (had, etf, acd, grd, trx, bdc, hbd). The substrates of 
      these pathways phenylalanine, leucine, glycine and some intermediates 
      (phenylpyruvate, 2-oxo-isocaproate, 3-hydroxy-butyryl-CoA, crotonyl-CoA) 
      accumulated, while end products like isocaproate and butyrate were found reduced. 
      Flavodoxin (fldX) formation and riboflavin biosynthesis (rib) were enhanced, most 
      likely to replace the missing ferredoxins. Proline reductase (prd), the 
      corresponding ion pumping RNF complex (rnf) and the reaction product 5-aminovalerate 
      were significantly enhanced. An ATP forming ATPase (atpCDGAHFEB) of the 
      F(0)F(1)-type was induced while the formation of a ATP-consuming, proton-pumping 
      V-type ATPase (atpDBAFCEKI) was decreased. The [Fe-S] enzyme-dependent pyruvate 
      formate lyase (pfl), formate dehydrogenase (fdh) and hydrogenase (hyd) branch of 
      glucose utilization and glycogen biosynthesis (glg) were significantly reduced, 
      leading to an accumulation of glucose and pyruvate. The formation of [Fe-S] enzyme 
      carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (coo) was inhibited. The fur mutant showed an 
      increased sensitivity to vancomycin and polymyxin B. An intensive remodeling of the 
      cell wall was observed, Polyamine biosynthesis (spe) was induced leading to an 
      accumulation of spermine, spermidine, and putrescine. The fur mutant lost most of 
      its flagella and motility. Finally, the CRISPR/Cas and a prophage encoding operon 
      were downregulated. Fur binding sites were found upstream of around 20 of the 
      regulated genes. Overall, adaptation to low iron conditions in C. difficile focused 
      on an increase of iron import, a significant replacement of iron requiring metabolic 
      pathways and the restructuring of the cell surface for protection during the complex 
      adaptation phase and was only partly directly regulated by Fur.

AB  - Viruses and plasmids (invasive mobile genetic elements (iMGEs)) have important roles 
      in shaping microbial communities, but their dynamic interactions with CRISPR-based 
      immunity remain unresolved. We analysed generation-resolved iMGE-host dynamics 
      spanning one and a half years in a microbial consortium from a biological wastewater 
      treatment plant using integrated meta-omics. We identified 31 bacterial 
      metagenome-assembled genomes encoding complete CRISPR-Cas systems and their 
      corresponding iMGEs. CRISPR-targeted plasmids outnumbered their bacteriophage 
      counterparts by at least fivefold, highlighting the importance of CRISPR-mediated 
      defence against plasmids. Linear modelling of our time-series data revealed that the 
      variation in plasmid abundance over time explained more of the observed community 
      dynamics than phages. Community-scale CRISPR-based plasmid-host and phage-host 
      interaction networks revealed an increase in CRISPR-mediated interactions coinciding 
      with a decrease in the dominant 'Candidatus Microthrix parvicella' population. 
      Protospacers were enriched in sequences targeting genes involved in the transmission 
      of iMGEs. Understanding the factors shaping the fitness of specific populations is 
      necessary to devise control strategies for undesirable species and to predict or 
      explain community-wide phenotypes.

AB  - In today's scenario of global climate change, there is a colossal demand for 
      sustainable industrial processes and enzymes from thermophiles. Plausibly, 
      thermozymes are an important toolkit, as they are known to be polyextremophilic in 
      nature. Small genome size and diverse molecular conformational modifications have 
      been implicated in devising adaptive strategies. Besides, the utilization of 
      chemical technology and gene editing attributions according to mechanical 
      necessities are the additional key factor for efficacious bioprocess development. 
      Microbial thermozymes have been extensively used in waste management, biofuel, food, 
      paper, detergent, medicinal and pharmaceutical industries. To understand the 
      strength of enzymes at higher temperatures different models utilize X-ray structures 
      of thermostable proteins, machine learning calculations, neural networks, but 
      unified adaptive measures are yet to be totally comprehended. The present review 
      provides a recent updates on thermozymes and various interdisciplinary applications 
      including the aspects of thermophiles bioengineering utilizing synthetic biology and 
      gene editing tools.

AB  - Eukaryotic cells are precisely "wired" to coordinate changes in external and 
      intracellular signals with corresponding adjustments in the output of complex and 
      often interconnected signaling pathways. These pathways are critical in 
      understanding cellular growth and function, and several experimental trends are 
      emerging with applicability toward more fully describing the composition and 
      topology of eukaryotic signaling networks. In particular, recent studies have 
      implemented CRISPR/Cas-based screens in mouse and human cell lines for genes 
      involved in various cell growth and disease phenotypes. Proteomic methods using mass 
      spectrometry have enabled quantitative and dynamic profiling of protein 
      interactions, revealing previously undiscovered complexes and allele-specific 
      protein interactions. Methods for the single-cell study of protein localization and 
      gene expression have been integrated with computational analyses to provide insight 
      into cell signaling in yeast and metazoans. In this review, we present an overview 
      of exemplary studies using the above approaches, relevant for the analysis of cell 
      signaling and indeed, more broadly, for many modern biological applications.

PG  - 79-98
LID - 10.1080/07388551.2018.1500997 [doi]
AB  - Today, environmental pollution is a serious problem, and bioremediation can play an 
      important role in cleaning contaminated sites. Remediation strategies, such as 
      chemical and physical approaches, are not enough to mitigate pollution problems 
      because of the continuous generation of novel recalcitrant pollutants due to 
      anthropogenic activities. Bioremediation using microbes is an eco-friendly and 
      socially acceptable alternative to conventional remediation approaches. Many 
      microbes with a bioremediation potential have been isolated and characterized but, 
      in many cases, cannot completely degrade the targeted pollutant or are ineffective 
      in situations with mixed wastes. This review envisages advances in systems biology 
      (SB), which enables the analysis of microbial behavior at a community level under 
      different environmental stresses. By applying a SB approach, crucial preliminary 
      information can be obtained for metabolic engineering (ME) of microbes for their 
      enhanced bioremediation capabilities. This review also highlights the integrated SB 
      and ME tools and techniques for bioremediation purposes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the wake of rising energy demands, microalgae have emerged as 
      potential sources of sustainable and renewable carbon-neutral fuels, such as 
      bio-hydrogen and bio-oil. PURPOSE: For rational metabolic engineering, the 
      elucidation of metabolic pathways in fine detail and their manipulation according to 
      requirements is the key to exploiting the use of microalgae. Emergence of 
      site-specific nucleases have revolutionized applied research leading to 
      biotechnological gains. Genome engineering as well as modulation of the endogenous 
      genome with high precision using CRISPR systems is being gradually employed in 
      microalgal research. Further, to optimize and produce better algal platforms, use of 
      systems biology network analysis and integration of omics data is required. This 
      review discusses two important approaches: systems biology and gene editing 
      strategies used on microalgal systems with a focus on biofuel production and 
      sustainable solutions. It also emphasizes that the integration of such systems would 
      contribute and compliment applied research on microalgae. CONCLUSIONS: Recent 
      advances in microalgae are discussed, including systems biology, gene editing 
      approaches in lipid bio-synthesis, and antenna engineering. Lastly, it has been 
      attempted here to showcase how CRISPR/Cas systems are a better editing tool than 
      existing techniques that can be utilized for gene modulation and engineering during 
      biofuel production.

TI  - Regulatory RNAs in the Less Studied Streptococcal Species: From Nomenclature to 
      Identification.
PG  - 1161

AB  - Streptococcal species are Gram-positive bacteria involved in severe and invasive 
      diseases in humans and animals. Although, this group includes different pathogenic 
      species involved in life-threatening infections for humans, it also includes 
      beneficial species, such as Streptococcus thermophilus, which is used in yogurt 
      production. In bacteria virulence factors are controlled by various regulatory 
      networks including regulatory RNAs. For clearness and to develop logical thinking, 
      we start this review with a revision of regulatory RNAs nomenclature. Previous 
      reviews are mostly dealing with Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae 
      regulatory RNAs. We especially focused our analysis on regulatory RNAs in 
      Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus thermophilus and other 
      less studied Streptococcus species. Although, S. agalactiae RNome remains largely 
      unknown, sRNAs (small RNAs) are supposed to mediate regulation during environmental 
      adaptation and host infection. In the case of S. mutans, sRNAs are suggested to be 
      involved in competence regulation, carbohydrate metabolism, and Toxin-Antitoxin 
      systems. A new category of miRNA-size small RNAs (msRNAs) was also identified for 
      the first time in this species. The analysis of S. thermophilus sRNome shows that 
      many sRNAs are associated to the bacterial immune system known as CRISPR-Cas system. 
      Only few of the other different Streptococcus species have been the subject of 
      studies pointed toward the characterization of regulatory RNAs. Finally, 
      understanding bacterial sRNome can constitute one step forward to the elaboration of 
      new strategies in therapy such as substitution of antibiotics in the management of 
      S. agalactiae neonatal infections, prevention of S. mutans dental caries or use of 
      S. thermophilus CRISPR-Cas system in genome editing applications.

TI  - AcrHub: an integrative hub for investigating, predicting and mapping anti-CRISPR 
      proteins.
PG  - D630-D638
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkaa951 [doi]
AB  - Anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins naturally inhibit CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems 
      across bacterial and archaeal domains of life. This emerging field has caused a 
      paradigm shift in the way we think about the CRISPR-Cas system, and promises a 
      number of useful applications from gene editing to phage therapy. As the number of 
      verified and predicted Acrs rapidly expands, few online resources have been 
      developed to deal with this wealth of information. To overcome this shortcoming, we 
      developed AcrHub, an integrative database to provide an all-in-one solution for 
      investigating, predicting and mapping Acr proteins. AcrHub catalogs 339 
      non-redundant experimentally validated Acrs and over 70 000 predicted Acrs extracted 
      from genome sequence data from a diverse range of prokaryotic organisms and their 
      viruses. It integrates state-of-the-art predictors to predict potential Acrs, and 
      incorporates three analytical modules: similarity analysis, phylogenetic analysis 
      and homology network analysis, to analyze their relationships with known Acrs. By 
      interconnecting all modules as a platform, AcrHub presents enriched and in-depth 
      analysis of known and potential Acrs and therefore provides new and exciting 
      insights into the future of Acr discovery and validation. AcrHub is freely available 
      at http://pacrispr.erc.monash.edu/AcrHub/.

AB  - Target RNA binding to crRNA-bound type III-A CRISPR-Cas multi-subunit Csm 
      surveillance complexes activates cyclic-oligoadenylate (cA(n)) formation from ATP 
      subunits positioned within the composite pair of Palm domain pockets of the Csm1 
      subunit. The generated cA(n) second messenger in turn targets the CARF domain of 
      trans-acting RNase Csm6, triggering its HEPN domain-based RNase activity. We have 
      undertaken cryo-EM studies on multi-subunit Thermococcus onnurineus Csm effector 
      ternary complexes, as well as X-ray studies on Csm1-Csm4 cassette, both bound to 
      substrate (AMPPNP), intermediates (pppA(n)), and products (cA(n)), to decipher 
      mechanistic aspects of cA(n) formation and release. A network of intermolecular 
      hydrogen bond alignments accounts for the observed adenosine specificity, with 
      ligand positioning dictating formation of linear pppA(n) intermediates and 
      subsequent cA(n) formation by cyclization. We combine our structural results with 
      published functional studies to highlight mechanistic insights into the role of the 
      Csm effector complex in mediating the cA(n) signaling pathway.

TI  - Generation of WNK1 knockout cell lines by CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing.
PG  - F366-76
LID - 10.1152/ajprenal.00612.2014 [doi]
AB  - Sodium-coupled SLC12 cation chloride cotransporters play important roles in cell 
      volume and chloride homeostasis, epithelial fluid secretion, and renal tubular salt 
      reabsorption. These cotransporters are phosphorylated and activated indirectly by 
      With-No-Lysine (WNK) kinases through their downstream effector kinases, Ste20- and 
      SPS1-related proline alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) and oxidative stress-responsive 
      kinase 1 (OSR1). Multiple WNK kinases can coexist within a single cell type, 
      although their relative contributions to SPAK/OSR1 activation and salt transport 
      remain incompletely understood. Deletion of specific WNKs from cells that natively 
      express a functional WNK-SPAK/OSR1 network will help resolve these knowledge gaps. 
      Here, we outline a simple method to selectively knock out full-length WNK1 
      expression from mammalian cells using RNA-guided clustered regularly interspaced 
      short palindromic repeats/Cas9 endonucleases. Two clonal cell lines were generated 
      by using a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting exon 1 of the WNK1 gene, which 
      produced indels that abolished WNK1 protein expression. Both cell lines exhibited 
      reduced endogenous WNK4 protein abundance, indicating that WNK1 is required for WNK4 
      stability. Consistent with an on-target effect, the reduced WNK4 abundance was 
      associated with increased expression of the KLHL3/cullin-3 E3 ubiquitin ligase 
      complex and was rescued by exogenous WNK1 overexpression. Although the morphology of 
      the knockout cells was indistinguishable from control, they exhibited low baseline 
      SPAK/OSR1 activity and failed to trigger regulatory volume increase after hypertonic 
      stress, confirming an essential role for WNK1 in cell volume regulation. 
      Collectively, our data show how this new, powerful, and accessible gene-editing 
      technology can be used to dissect and analyze WNK signaling networks.

AB  - Design and construction of an optimal microbial cell factory typically requires 
      overexpression, knockdown, and knockout of multiple gene targets. In this chapter, 
      we describe a combinatorial metabolic engineering strategy utilizing an orthogonal 
      trifunctional CRISPR system that combines transcriptional activation, 
      transcriptional interference, and gene deletion (CRISPR-AID) in the yeast 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This strategy enables multiplexed perturbation of the 
      metabolic and regulatory networks in a modular, parallel, and high-throughput 
      manner. To implement this system, three orthogonal Cas proteins were utilized: 
      dLbCpf1 fused to a transcriptional activator, dSpCas9 fused to a transcriptional 
      repressor, and SaCas9 for gene deletion. Deletion was accomplished by the 
      introduction of a 28bp frame-shift mutation using a homology donor on the guide RNA 
      expression vector. This approach enables the application of metabolic engineering to 
      systematically optimize phenotypes of interest through a combination of gain-, 
      reduction-, and loss-of-function mutations. Finally, we describe the construction of 
      the CRISPR-AID system and its application toward engineering an example phenotype, 
      surface display of recombinant Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase II.

AB  - Transcriptional regulation is central to the complex behavior of natural biological 
      systems and synthetic gene circuits. Platforms for the scalable, tunable, and simple 
      modulation of transcription would enable new abilities to study natural systems and 
      implement artificial capabilities in living cells. Previous approaches to synthetic 
      transcriptional regulation have relied on engineering DNA-binding proteins, which 
      necessitate multistep processes for construction and optimization of function. Here, 
      we show that the CRISPR/Cas system of Streptococcus pyogenes can be programmed to 
      direct both activation and repression to natural and artificial eukaryotic promoters 
      through the simple engineering of guide RNAs with base-pairing complementarity to 
      target DNA sites. We demonstrate that the activity of CRISPR-based transcription 
      factors (crisprTFs) can be tuned by directing multiple crisprTFs to different 
      positions in natural promoters and by arraying multiple crisprTF-binding sites in 
      the context of synthetic promoters in yeast and human cells. Furthermore, externally 
      controllable regulatory modules can be engineered by layering gRNAs with small 
      molecule-responsive proteins. Additionally, single nucleotide substitutions within 
      promoters are sufficient to render them orthogonal with respect to the same 
      gRNA-guided crisprTF. We envision that CRISPR-based eukaryotic gene regulation will 
      enable the facile construction of scalable synthetic gene circuits and open up new 
      approaches for mapping natural gene networks and their effects on complex cellular 
      phenotypes.

AB  - Virophages are satellite DNA viruses that depend for their replication on giant 
      viruses of the family Mimiviridae. An evolutionary relationship exists between the 
      virophages and Polintons, large self-synthesizing transposons that are wide spread 
      in the genomes of diverse eukaryotes. Most of the Polintons encode homologs of major 
      and minor icosahedral virus capsid proteins and accordingly are predicted to form 
      virions. Additionally, metagenome analysis has led to the discovery of an expansive 
      family of Polinton-like viruses (PLV) that are more distantly related to bona fide 
      Polintons and virophages. Another group of giant virus parasites includes small, 
      linear, double-stranded DNA elements called transpovirons. Recent in-depth 
      comparative genomic analysis has yielded evidence of the origin of the PLV and the 
      transpovirons from Polintons. Integration of virophage genomes into genomes of both 
      giant viruses and protists has been demonstrated. Furthermore, in an experimental 
      coinfection system that consisted of a protist host, a giant virus and an associated 
      virophage, the virophage integrated into the host genome and, after activation of 
      its expression by a superinfecting giant virus, served as an agent of adaptive 
      immunity. There is a striking analogy between this mechanism and the CRISPR-Cas 
      system of prokaryotic adaptive immunity. Taken together, these findings show that 
      Polintons, PLV, virophages and transpovirons form a dynamic network of integrating 
      mobile genetic elements that contribute to the cellular antivirus defense and 
      host-virus coevolution.

AB  - CRISPR-Cas transcriptional circuits hold great promise as platforms for engineering 
      metabolic networks and information processing circuits. Historically, prokaryotic 
      CRISPR control systems have been limited to CRISPRi. Creating approaches to 
      integrate CRISPRa for transcriptional activation with existing CRISPRi-based systems 
      would greatly expand CRISPR circuit design space. Here, we develop design principles 
      for engineering prokaryotic CRISPRa/i genetic circuits with network topologies 
      specified by guide RNAs. We demonstrate that multi-layer CRISPRa/i cascades and 
      feedforward loops can operate through the regulated expression of guide RNAs in 
      cell-free expression systems and E. coli. We show that CRISPRa/i circuits can 
      program complex functions by designing type 1 incoherent feedforward loops acting as 
      fold-change detectors and tunable pulse-generators. By investigating how component 
      characteristics relate to network properties such as depth, width, and speed, this 
      work establishes a framework for building scalable CRISPRa/i circuits as regulatory 
      programs in cell-free expression systems and bacterial hosts. A record of this 
      paper's transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

TI  - SCNrank: spectral clustering for network-based ranking to reveal potential drug 
      targets and its application in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
PG  - 50

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common pancreatic 
      malignancy. Due to its wide heterogeneity, PDAC acts aggressively and responds 
      poorly to most chemotherapies, causing an urgent need for the development of new 
      therapeutic strategies. Cell lines have been used as the foundation for drug 
      development and disease modeling. CRISPR-Cas9 plays a key role in every step-in drug 
      discovery: from target identification and validation to preclinical cancer cell 
      testing. Using cell-line models and CRISPR-Cas9 technology together make drug target 
      prediction feasible. However, there is still a large gap between predicted results 
      and actionable targets in real tumors. Biological network models provide great modus 
      to mimic genetic interactions in real biological systems, which can benefit gene 
      perturbation studies and potential target identification for treating PDAC. 
      Nevertheless, building a network model that takes cell-line data and CRISPR-Cas9 
      data as input to accurately predict potential targets that will respond well on real 
      tissue remains unsolved. METHODS: We developed a novel algorithm 'Spectral 
      Clustering for Network-based target Ranking' (SCNrank) that systematically 
      integrates three types of data: expression profiles from tumor tissue, normal tissue 
      and cell-line PDAC; protein-protein interaction network (PPI); and CRISPR-Cas9 data 
      to prioritize potential drug targets for PDAC. The whole algorithm can be classified 
      into three steps: 1. using STRING PPI network skeleton, SCNrank constructs 
      tissue-specific networks with PDAC tumor and normal pancreas tissues from expression 
      profiles; 2. With the same network skeleton, SCNrank constructs cell-line-specific 
      networks using the cell-line PDAC expression profiles and CRISPR-Cas 9 data from 
      pancreatic cancer cell-lines; 3. SCNrank applies a novel spectral clustering 
      approach to reduce data dimension and generate gene clusters that carry common 
      features from both networks. Finally, SCNrank applies a scoring scheme called 
      'Target Influence score' (TI), which estimates a given target's influence towards 
      the cluster it belongs to, for scoring and ranking each drug target. RESULTS: We 
      applied SCNrank to analyze 263 expression profiles, CRPSPR-Cas9 data from 22 
      different pancreatic cancer cell-lines and the STRING protein-protein interaction 
      (PPI) network. With SCNrank, we successfully constructed an integrated tissue PDAC 
      network and an integrated cell-line PDAC network, both of which contain 4414 
      selected genes that are overexpressed in tumor tissue samples. After clustering, 
      4414 genes are distributed into 198 clusters, which include 367 targets of FDA 
      approved drugs. These drug targets are all scored and ranked by their TI scores, 
      which we defined to measure their influence towards the network. We validated 
      top-ranked targets in three aspects: Firstly, mapping them onto the existing 
      clinical drug targets of PDAC to measure the concordance. Secondly, we performed 
      enrichment analysis to these drug targets and the clusters there are within, to 
      reveal functional associations between clusters and PDAC; Thirdly, we performed 
      survival analysis for the top-ranked targets to connect targets with clinical 
      outcomes. Survival analysis reveals that overexpression of three top-ranked genes, 
      PGK1, HMMR and POLE2, significantly increases the risk of death in PDAC patients. 
      CONCLUSION: SCNrank is an unbiased algorithm that systematically integrates multiple 
      types of omics data to do potential drug target selection and ranking. SCNrank shows 
      great capability in predicting drug targets for PDAC. Pancreatic cancer-associated 
      gene candidates predicted by our SCNrank approach have the potential to guide 
      genetics-based anti-pancreatic drug discovery.

TI  - Single molecule network analysis identifies structural changes to caveolae and 
      scaffolds due to mutation of the caveolin-1 scaffolding domain.

AB  - Caveolin-1 (CAV1), the caveolae coat protein, also associates with non-caveolar 
      scaffold domains. Single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) network analysis 
      distinguishes caveolae and three scaffold domains, hemispherical S2 scaffolds and 
      smaller S1B and S1A scaffolds. The caveolin scaffolding domain (CSD) is a highly 
      conserved hydrophobic region that mediates interaction of CAV1 with multiple 
      effector molecules. F92A/V94A mutation disrupts CSD function, however the structural 
      impact of CSD mutation on caveolae or scaffolds remains unknown. Here, SMLM network 
      analysis quantitatively shows that expression of the CAV1 CSD F92A/V94A mutant in 
      CRISPR/Cas CAV1 knockout MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells reduces the size and volume 
      and enhances the elongation of caveolae and scaffold domains, with more pronounced 
      effects on S2 and S1B scaffolds. Convex hull analysis of the outer surface of the 
      CAV1 point clouds confirms the size reduction of CSD mutant CAV1 blobs and shows 
      that CSD mutation reduces volume variation amongst S2 and S1B CAV1 blobs at 
      increasing shrink values, that may reflect retraction of the CAV1 N-terminus towards 
      the membrane, potentially preventing accessibility of the CSD. Detection of point 
      mutation-induced changes to CAV1 domains highlights the utility of SMLM network 
      analysis for mesoscale structural analysis of oligomers in their native environment.

AB  - Genomic editing technologies are developing rapidly, promising significant 
      developments for biomedicine, agriculture and other fields. In the present 
      investigation, we analyzed and compared the process of innovation for six genomic 
      technologies: viral vectors, RNAi, TALENs, meganucleases, ZFNs and CRISPR/Cas 
      including the profile of the main research institutions and their funders, to 
      understand how innovation evolved and what institutions influenced research 
      trajectories. A Web of Science search of papers on viral vectors RNAi, CRISPR/Cas, 
      TALENs, ZFNs and meganucleases was used to build a citation network of 16,746 
      papers. An analysis of network clustering combined with text mining was performed. 
      For viral vectors, a long-term process of incremental innovation was identified, 
      which was largely publicly funded in the United States and the European Union. The 
      trajectory of RNAi research included clusters related to the study of RNAi as a 
      biological phenomenon and its use in functional genomics, biomedicine and pest 
      control. A British philanthropic organization and a US pharmaceutical company played 
      a key role in the development of basic RNAi research and clinical application 
      respectively, in addition to government and academic institutions. In the case of 
      CRISPR/Cas research, basic science discoveries led to the technical improvements, 
      and these two in turn provided the information required for the development of 
      biomedical, agricultural, livestock and industrial applications. The trajectory of 
      CRISPR/Cas research exhibits a geopolitical division of the investigation efforts 
      between the US, as the main producer and funder of basic research and technical 
      improvements, and Chinese research institutions increasingly leading applied 
      research. Our results reflect a change in the model for financing science, with 
      reduced public financing for basic science and applied research on publicly funded 
      technological developments in the US, and the emergence of China as a scientific 
      superpower, with implications for the development of applications of genomic 
      technologies.

AB  - Over the past two decades, the discovery of CRISPR-Cas immune systems and the 
      repurposing of their effector nucleases as biotechnological tools have 
      revolutionized genome editing. The corresponding work has been captured by 90,000 
      authors representing 7,600 affiliations in 126 countries, who have published more 
      than 19,000 papers spanning medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology. Here, we use 
      tech mining and an integrated bibliometric and networks framework to investigate the 
      CRISPR literature over three time periods. The analysis identified seminal papers, 
      leading authors, influential journals, and rising applications and topics 
      interconnected through collaborative networks. A core set of foundational topics 
      gave rise to diverging avenues of research and applications, reflecting a bona fide 
      disruptive emerging technology. This analysis illustrates how bibliometrics can 
      identify key factors, decipher rising trends, and untangle emerging applications and 
      technologies that dynamically shape a morphing field, and provides insights into the 
      trajectory of genome editing.

AB  - Transcriptional regulation by nuclease-deficient CRISPR/Cas is a popular and 
      valuable tool for routine control of gene expression. CRISPR interference in 
      bacteria can be reliably achieved with high efficiencies. Yet, options for CRISPR 
      activation (CRISPRa) remained limited in flexibility and activity because they 
      relied on σ(70) promoters. Here we report a eukaryote-like bacterial CRISPRa system 
      based on σ(54)-dependent promoters, which supports long distance, and hence 
      multi-input regulation with high dynamic ranges. Our CRISPRa device can activate 
      σ(54)-dependent promoters with biotechnology relevance in non-model bacteria. It 
      also supports orthogonal gene regulation on multiple levels. Combining our CRISPRa 
      with dxCas9 further expands flexibility in DNA targeting, and boosts dynamic ranges 
      into regimes that enable construction of cascaded CRISPRa circuits. 
      Application-wise, we construct a reusable scanning platform for readily optimizing 
      metabolic pathways without library reconstructions. This eukaryote-like CRISPRa 
      system is therefore a powerful and versatile synthetic biology tool for diverse 
      research and industrial applications.

PG  - 14832
LID - 10.1038/ncomms14832 [doi]
LID - 14832
AB  - Migration frequently involves Rac-mediated protrusion of lamellipodia, formed by 
      Arp2/3 complex-dependent branching thought to be crucial for force generation and 
      stability of these networks. The formins FMNL2 and FMNL3 are Cdc42 effectors 
      targeting to the lamellipodium tip and shown here to nucleate and elongate actin 
      filaments with complementary activities in vitro. In migrating B16-F1 melanoma 
      cells, both formins contribute to the velocity of lamellipodium protrusion. Loss of 
      FMNL2/3 function in melanoma cells and fibroblasts reduces lamellipodial width, 
      actin filament density and -bundling, without changing patterns of Arp2/3 complex 
      incorporation. Strikingly, in melanoma cells, FMNL2/3 gene inactivation almost 
      completely abolishes protrusion forces exerted by lamellipodia and modifies their 
      ultrastructural organization. Consistently, CRISPR/Cas-mediated depletion of FMNL2/3 
      in fibroblasts reduces both migration and capability of cells to move against 
      viscous media. Together, we conclude that force generation in lamellipodia strongly 
      depends on FMNL formin activity, operating in addition to Arp2/3 complex-dependent 
      filament branching.

AB  - BACKGROUND: CRISPR (Clustered, Regularly, Interspaced, Short, Palindromic Repeats) 
      loci provide prokaryotes with an adaptive immunity against viruses and other mobile 
      genetic elements. CRISPR arrays can be transcribed and processed into small crRNA 
      molecules, which are then used by the cell to target the foreign nucleic acid. Since 
      spacers are accumulated by active CRISPR/Cas systems, the sequences of these spacers 
      provide a record of the past "infection history" of the organism. RESULTS: Here we 
      analyzed all currently known spacers present in archaeal genomes and identified 
      their source by DNA similarity. While nearly 50% of archaeal spacers matched mobile 
      genetic elements, such as plasmids or viruses, several others matched chromosomal 
      genes of other organisms, primarily other archaea. Thus, networks of gene exchange 
      between archaeal species were revealed by the spacer analysis, including many cases 
      of inter-genus and inter-species gene transfer events. Spacers that recognize viral 
      sequences tend to be located further away from the leader sequence, implying that 
      there exists a selective pressure for their retention. CONCLUSIONS: CRISPR spacers 
      provide direct evidence for extensive gene exchange in archaea, especially within 
      genera, and support the current dogma where the primary role of the CRISPR/Cas 
      system is anti-viral and anti-plasmid defense. OPEN PEER REVIEW: This article was

TI  - Combinatorial pathway engineering using type I-E CRISPR interference.

AB  - Optimization of metabolic flux is a difficult and time-consuming process that often 
      involves changing the expression levels of multiple genes simultaneously. While some 
      pathways have a known rate limiting step, more complex metabolic networks can 
      require a trial-and-error approach of tuning the expression of multiple genes to 
      achieve a desired distribution of metabolic resources. Here we present an efficient 
      method for generating expression diversity on a combinatorial scale using CRISPR 
      interference. We use a modified native Escherichia coli Type I-E CRISPR-Cas system 
      and an iterative cloning strategy for construction of guide RNA arrays. This 
      approach allowed us to build a combinatorial gene expression library three orders of 
      magnitude larger than previous studies. In less than 1 month, we generated ∼12,000 
      combinatorial gene expression variants that target six different genes and screened 
      these variants for increased malonyl-CoA flux and 3-hydroxypropionate (3HP) 
      production. We were able to identify a set of variants that exhibited a significant 
      increase in malonyl-CoA flux and up to a 98% increase in 3HP production. This 
      approach provides a fast and easy-to-implement strategy for engineering metabolic 
      pathway flux for development of industrially relevant strains, as well as 
      investigation of fundamental biological questions.

TI  - A long non-coding RNA (Lrap) modulates brain gene expression and levels of alcohol 
      consumption in rats.
PG  - e12698
LID - 10.1111/gbb.12698 [doi]
LID - e12698
AB  - LncRNAs are important regulators of quantitative and qualitative features of the 
      transcriptome. We have used QTL and other statistical analyses to identify a gene 
      coexpression module associated with alcohol consumption. The "hub gene" of this 
      module, Lrap (Long non-coding RNA for alcohol preference), was an unannotated 
      transcript resembling a lncRNA. We used partial correlation analyses to establish 
      that Lrap is a major contributor to the integrity of the coexpression module. Using 
      CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we disrupted an exon of Lrap in Wistar rats. Measures of 
      alcohol consumption in wild type, heterozygous and knockout rats showed that 
      disruption of Lrap produced increases in alcohol consumption/alcohol preference. The 
      disruption of Lrap also produced changes in expression of over 700 other 
      transcripts. Furthermore, it became apparent that Lrap may have a function in 
      alternative splicing of the affected transcripts. The GO category of "Response to 
      Ethanol" emerged as one of the top candidates in an enrichment analysis of the 
      differentially expressed transcripts. We validate the role of Lrap as a mediator of 
      alcohol consumption by rats, and also implicate Lrap as a modifier of the expression 
      and splicing of a large number of brain transcripts. A defined subset of these 
      transcripts significantly impacts alcohol consumption by rats (and possibly humans). 
      Our work shows the pleiotropic nature of non-coding elements of the genome, the 
      power of network analysis in identifying the critical elements influencing 
      phenotypes, and the fact that not all changes produced by genetic editing are 
      critical for the concomitant changes in phenotype.

AB  - Promoting sustainable agriculture and improving nutrition are the main united nation 
      sustainable development goals by 2030. New technologies are requested to achieve 
      zero hunger, and genome editing technology is the most promising one. In the last 
      decade, genome editing using the CRISPR/Cas system has attracted researcher as a 
      safer and easy tool for genome editing in several living organisms. GE has 
      revolutionized the field of agriculture by improving biotic and abiotic stresses and 
      yield improvement. GE technologies were developed fast lately to avoid the obstacles 
      that face GM crops. GE technology, depending on site directed nuclease (SDN), is 
      divided into three categories according to the modification methods. Developing 
      transgenic-free edited plants without introducing foreign DNA meet the acceptance 
      and regulatory ratification of several countries. There are several ongoing efforts 
      from different countries are rapidly expanding to adopt the current technological 
      innovations. This review summarizes the different GE technologies and their 
      application as a way to help in ending hunger.

      species.
PG  - 123-129
LID - 10.1016/j.gendis.2018.03.004 [doi]
AB  - CRISPR genome editing utilizes Cas9 nuclease and single guide RNA (sgRNA), which 
      directs the nuclease to a specific site in the genome and makes a double-stranded 
      break (DSB). Design of sgRNA for CRISPR-Cas targeting, and to promote CRISPR 
      adaptation, uses a regulatory mechanism that ensures maximum CRISPR-Cas9 system 
      functions when a bacterial population is at highest risk of phage infection. 
      Acinetobacter baumannii is the most regularly identified gram-negative bacterium 
      infecting patients. Recent reports have demonstrated that the extent of diseases 
      caused by A. baumannii is expanding and, in a few cases, now surpasses the quantity 
      of infections caused by P. aeruginosa. Most Acinetobacter strains possess 
      biofilm-forming ability, which plays a major role in virulence and drug resistance. 
      Biofilm bacteria use quorum sensing, a cell-to-cell communication process, to 
      activate gene expression. Many genes are involved in biofilm formation and the 
      mechanism to disrupt the biofilm network is still not clearly understood. In this 
      study, we performed in silico gene editing to exploit the AbaI gene, responsible for 
      biofilm formation. The study explored different tools available for genome editing 
      to create gene knockouts, selecting the A. baumannii AbaI gene as a target.

AB  - Coronaviruses (CoVs) are emergent pathogens that may cause life-threatening 
      respiratory diseases in humans. Understanding of CoV-host interactions may help to 
      identify novel therapeutic targets. MOV10 is an RNA helicase involved in different 
      steps of cellular RNA metabolism. Both MOV10 antiviral and proviral activities have 
      been described in a limited number of viruses, but this protein has not been 
      previously associated with CoVs. We found that during Middle East respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, MOV10 aggregated in cytoplasmic 
      structures colocalizing with viral nucleocapsid (N) protein. MOV10-N interaction was 
      confirmed by endogenous MOV10 coimmunoprecipitation, and the presence of other 
      cellular proteins was also detected in MOV10 complexes. MOV10 silencing 
      significantly increased both N protein accumulation and virus titer, with no changes 
      in the accumulation of viral RNAs. Moreover, MOV10 overexpression caused a 10-fold 
      decrease in viral titers. These data indicated that MOV10 has antiviral activity 
      during MERS-CoV infection. We postulated that this activity could be mediated by 
      viral RNA sequestration, and in fact, RNA immunoprecipitation data showed the 
      presence of viral RNAs in the MOV10 cytoplasmic complexes. Expression of wild-type 
      MOV10 or of a MOV10 mutant without helicase activity in MOV10 knockout cell lines, 
      developed by CRISPR-Cas technology, indicated that the helicase activity of MOV10 
      was required for its antiviral effect. Interestingly MOV10-N interaction was 
      conserved in other mildly or highly pathogenic human CoVs, including the recently 
      emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), although MOV10 
      antiviral activity was found only in highly pathogenic CoVs, suggesting a potential 
      role of MOV10 in the modulation of human CoVs pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses 
      (CoVs) are emerging pathogens causing life-threatening diseases in humans. Knowledge 
      of virus-host interactions and viral subversion mechanisms of host pathways is 
      required for the development of effective countermeasures against CoVs. The 
      interaction between cellular RNA helicase MOV10 and nucleocapsid (N) protein from 
      several human CoVs is shown. Using MERS-CoV as a model, we demonstrate that MOV10 
      has antiviral function, requiring its helicase activity, most likely mediated by 
      viral RNA sequestration in cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein structures. Furthermore, we 
      found that MOV10 antiviral activity may act only in highly pathogenic human CoVs, 
      suggesting a role for MOV10 in modulating CoVs pathogenesis. The present study 
      uncovers a complex network of viral and cellular RNAs and proteins interaction 
      modulating the antiviral response against CoVs.

      complex revealed by cryo-EM structures.

AB  - Bacteriophages encode anti-CRISPR suppressors to counteract the CRISPR/Cas immunity 
      of their bacterial hosts, thus facilitating their survival and replication. Previous 
      studies have shown that two phage-encoded anti-CRISPR proteins, AcrF1 and AcrF2, 
      suppress the type I-F CRISPR/Cas system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by preventing 
      target DNA recognition by the Csy surveillance complex, but the precise underlying 
      mechanism was unknown. Here we present the structure of AcrF1/2 bound to the Csy 
      complex determined by cryo-EM single-particle reconstruction. By structural 
      analysis, we found that AcrF1 inhibits target DNA recognition of the Csy complex by 
      interfering with base pairing between the DNA target strand and crRNA spacer. In 
      addition, multiple copies of AcrF1 bind to the Csy complex with different modes when 
      working individually or cooperating with AcrF2, which might exclude target DNA 
      binding through different mechanisms. Together with previous reports, we provide a 
      comprehensive working scenario for the two anti-CRISPR suppressors, AcrF1 and AcrF2, 
      which silence CRISPR/Cas immunity by targeting the Csy surveillance complex.

TI  - CRNKL1 Is a Highly Selective Regulator of Intron-Retaining HIV-1 and Cellular mRNAs.
LID - 10.1128/mBio.02525-20 [doi]
LID - e02525-20
AB  - The HIV-1 Rev protein is a nuclear export factor for unspliced and incompletely 
      spliced HIV-1 RNAs. Without Rev, these intron-retaining RNAs are trapped in the 
      nucleus. A genome-wide screen identified nine proteins of the spliceosome, which all 
      enhanced expression from the HIV-1 unspliced RNA after CRISPR/Cas knockdown. 
      Depletion of DHX38, WDR70, and four proteins of the Prp19-associated complex (ISY1, 
      BUD31, XAB2, and CRNKL1) resulted in a more than 20-fold enhancement of unspliced 
      HIV-1 RNA levels in the cytoplasm. Targeting of CRNKL1, DHX38, and BUD31 affected 
      nuclear export efficiencies of the HIV-1 unspliced RNA to a much larger extent than 
      splicing. Transcriptomic analyses further revealed that CRNKL1 also suppresses 
      cytoplasmic levels of a subset of cellular mRNAs, including some with selectively 
      retained introns. Thus, CRNKL1-dependent nuclear retention is a novel cellular 
      mechanism for the regulation of cytoplasmic levels of intron-retaining HIV-1 mRNAs, 
      which HIV-1 may have harnessed to direct its complex splicing pattern.IMPORTANCE To 
      regulate its complex splicing pattern, HIV-1 uses the adaptor protein Rev to shuttle 
      unspliced or partially spliced mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In the 
      absence of Rev, these RNAs are retained in the nucleus, but it is unclear why. Here 
      we identify cellular proteins whose depletion enhances cytoplasmic levels of the 
      HIV-1 unspliced RNA. Depletion of one of them, CRNKL1, also increases cytoplasmic 
      levels of a subset of intron-retaining cellular mRNA, suggesting that 
      CRNKL1-dependent nuclear retention may be a basic cellular mechanism exploited by 
      HIV-1.

AB  - CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing is a powerful tool for generating genetically 
      mutated cells and organisms. Linearisation of donor cassettes with this system has 
      been shown to facilitate both transgene donor insertion and targeted knock-in. Here, 
      we developed a donor plasmid that we name pCriMGET (plasmid of synthetic CRISPR 
      coded RNA target sequence-equipped donor plasmid-mediated gene targeting), in which 
      an off-target free synthetic CRISPR coded RNA-target sequence (syn-crRNA-TS) is 
      incorporated with a multi-cloning site, where a donor cassette can be inserted. With 
      co-expression of Cas9 and the syn-crRNA-TS guide RNA (gRNA), pCriMGET provides a 
      linearised donor cassette in vivo, thereby promoting the transgene donor insertion 
      and targeted knock-in. When co-injected with Cas9 protein and gRNA into murine 
      zygotes, pCriMGET yielded around 20% transgene insertion in embryos. This method 
      also achieved more than 25% in-frame knock-in at the mouse Tbx3 gene locus without 
      predicted insertion-deletion mutations using a transgene donor with 400-bp homology 
      arms. pCriMGET is therefore useful as a versatile CRISPR/Cas9-cleavable donor 
      plasmid for efficient integration and targeted knock-in of exogenous DNA in mice.

AB  - Enabled by its central role in the molecular networks that govern cell function, RNA 
      has been widely used for constructing components used in biological circuits for 
      synthetic biology. Nucleic acid nanotechnology, which exploits predictable nucleic 
      acid interactions to implement programmable molecular systems, has seen remarkable 
      advances in in vitro nanoscale self-assembly and molecular computation, enabling the 
      production of complex nanostructures and DNA-based neural networks. Living cells 
      genetically engineered to execute nucleic acid nanotechnology programs thus have 
      outstanding potential to significantly extend the current limits of synthetic 
      biology. This perspective discusses the recent developments and future challenges in 
      the field of synthetic bionanotechnology. Thus far, researchers in this emerging 
      area have implemented dozens of programmable RNA nanodevices that provide precise 
      control over gene expression at the transcriptional and translational levels and 
      through CRISPR/Cas effectors. Moreover, they have employed synthetic self-assembling 
      RNA networks in engineered bacteria to carry out computations featuring up to a 
      dozen inputs and to substantially enhance the rate of chemical synthesis. Continued 
      advancement of the field will benefit from improved in vivo strategies for 
      streamlining nucleic acid network synthesis and new approaches for enhancing network 
      function. As the field matures and the complexity gap between in vitro and in vivo 
      systems narrows, synthetic bionanotechnology promises to have diverse potential 
      applications ranging from intracellular circuits that detect and treat disease to 
      synthetic enzymatic pathways that efficiently produce novel drug molecules.

AB  - Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) have been studied for their capacity to translocate 
      across the lipid membrane of several cell types. In membrane translocation, these 
      peptides can remarkably transport biologically active hydrophilic molecules, such as 
      pharmaceuticals, nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and even high-molecular-weight 
      proteins, Fig. 3 into the cell cytoplasm and organelles. The development of CPPs as 
      transduction agents includes the modification of gene and protein expression, the 
      reprogramming and differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells and the 
      preparation of cellular vaccines. A relatively recent field of CPP application is 
      the transduction of plasmid DNA vectors and CPP-fusion proteins to modify genomes 
      and introduce new traits in cells and organisms. CPP-mediated transduction of 
      components for genome editing is an advantageous alternative to viral DNA vectors. 
      Engineered site-specific nucleases, such as Cre recombinase, ZFN, TALENs and CRISPR 
      associated protein (Cas), have been coupled to CPPs, and the fused proteins have 
      been used to permeate targeted cells and tissues. The functionally active fusion 
      CPP-nucleases subsequently home to the nucleus, incise genomic DNA at specific sites 
      and induce repair and recombination. This review has the objective of discussing 
      CPPs and elucidating the prospective use of CPP-mediated transduction technology, 
      particularly in genome modification and transgenesis.

TI  - A CRISPR-based approach for targeted DNA demethylation.
PG  - 16009
LID - 10.1038/celldisc.2016.9 [doi]
AB  - In mammalian cells, DNA methylation critically regulates gene expression and thus 
      has pivotal roles in myriad of physiological and pathological processes. Here we 
      report a novel method for targeted DNA demethylation using the widely used clustered 
      regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas system. Initially, 
      modified single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) (sgRNA2.0) were constructed by inserting two 
      copies of bacteriophage MS2 RNA elements into the conventional sgRNAs, which would 
      facilitate the tethering of the Tet1 catalytic domain (Tet-CD), in fusion with dCas9 
      or MS2 coat proteins, to the targeted gene loci. Subsequently, such system was shown 
      to significantly upregulate transcription of the target genes, including RANKL, 
      MAGEB2 or MMP2, which was in close correlation to DNA demethylation of their 
      neighboring CpGs in the promoters. In addition, the dCas9/sgRNA2.0-directed 
      demethylation system appeared to afford efficient demethylation of the target genes 
      with tenuous off-target effects. Applications of this system would not only help us 
      understand mechanistically how DNA methylation might regulate gene expression in 
      specific contexts, but also enable control of gene expression and functionality with 
      potential clinical benefits.

AB  - To construct CRISPR/Cas9 vectors for the editing of SmPAL1 in the phenylpropane 
      metabolic pathway of Salvia miltiorrhiza, CIRSPR/Cas9 target sites of SmPAL1 were 
      designed by online software. Its target efficiencies were detected in vitro by 
      enzyme digestion and sequences with highly efficiency were constructed into 
      CRISPR/Cas9 vectors. Three possible CRISPR target sequences (SmPAL1-g1, SmPAL1-g2, 
      SmPAL1-g3) were designed and the enzyme digestion efficiencies were 53.3%, 76.6% and 
      10.0%. SmPAL1-g1 and SmPAL1-g2 were constructed into vector VK005-03 named as 
      VK005-03-g1 and VK005-03-g2. The results of sequencing showed that the two 
      CRISPR/Cas target sequences were all constructed into VK005-03. Here we first laid 
      the foundation for the study of SmPAL1 and provided an effective strategy for the 
      screening of sgRNA.

      Plants for Diversified and Sustainable Food Security.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22158093 [doi]
LID - 8093
AB  - Indigenous communities across the globe, especially in rural areas, consume locally 
      available plants known as Traditional Food Plants (TFPs) for their nutritional and 
      health-related needs. Recent research shows that many TFPs are highly nutritious as 
      they contain health beneficial metabolites, vitamins, mineral elements and other 
      nutrients. Excessive reliance on the mainstream staple crops has its own 
      disadvantages. Traditional food plants are nowadays considered important crops of 
      the future and can act as supplementary foods for the burgeoning global population. 
      They can also act as emergency foods in situations such as COVID-19 and in times of 
      other pandemics. The current situation necessitates locally available alternative 
      nutritious TFPs for sustainable food production. To increase the cultivation or 
      improve the traits in TFPs, it is essential to understand the molecular basis of the 
      genes that regulate some important traits such as nutritional components and 
      resilience to biotic and abiotic stresses. The integrated use of modern omics and 
      gene editing technologies provide great opportunities to better understand the 
      genetic and molecular basis of superior nutrient content, climate-resilient traits 
      and adaptation to local agroclimatic zones. Recently, realizing the importance and 
      benefits of TFPs, scientists have shown interest in the prospection and sequencing 
      of TFPs for their improvements, cultivation and mainstreaming. Integrated omics such 
      as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and ionomics are successfully 
      used in plants and have provided a comprehensive understanding of 
      gene-protein-metabolite networks. Combined use of omics and editing tools has led to 
      successful editing of beneficial traits in several TFPs. This suggests that there is 
      ample scope for improvement of TFPs for sustainable food production. In this 
      article, we highlight the importance, scope and progress towards improvement of TFPs 
      for valuable traits by integrated use of omics and gene editing techniques.

AB  - Bacteriophage-encoded single strand annealing proteins (SSAPs) are recombinases 
      which can substitute the classical, bacterial RecA and manage the DNA metabolism at 
      different steps of phage propagation. SSAPs have been shown to efficiently promote 
      recombination between short and rather divergent DNA sequences and were exploited 
      for in vivo genetic engineering mainly in Gram-negative bacteria. In opposition to 
      the conserved and almost universal bacterial RecA protein, SSAPs display great 
      sequence diversity. The importance for SSAPs in phage biology and phage-bacteria 
      evolution is underlined by their role as key players in events of horizontal gene 
      transfer (HGT). All of the above provoke a constant interest for the identification 
      and study of new phage recombinase proteins in vivo, in vitro as well as in silico. 
      Despite this, a huge body of putative ssap genes escapes conventional 
      classification, as they are not properly annotated. In this work, we performed a 
      wide-scale identification, classification and analysis of SSAPs encoded by the 
      Firmicutes bacteria and their phages. By using sequence similarity network and gene 
      context analyses, we created a new high quality dataset of phage-related SSAPs, 
      substantially increasing the number of annotated SSAPs. We classified the identified 
      SSAPs into seven distinct families, namely RecA, Gp2.5, RecT/Redβ, Erf, Rad52/22, 
      Sak3, and Sak4, organized into three superfamilies. Analysis of the relationships 
      between the revealed protein clusters led us to recognize Sak3-like proteins as a 
      new distinct SSAP family. Our analysis showed an irregular phylogenetic distribution 
      of ssap genes among different bacterial phyla and specific phages, which can be 
      explained by the high rates of ssap HGT. We propose that the evolution of phage 
      recombinases could be tightly linked to the dissemination of bacterial 
      phage-resistance mechanisms (e.g., abortive infection and CRISPR/Cas systems) 
      targeting ssap genes and be a part of the constant phage-bacteria arms race.

AB  - Diabetic nephropathy is the most common chronic kidney disease in the world and the 
      main cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The structural integrity of podocytes 
      is fundamental to the normal function of the glomerulus, and the role of glycogen 
      synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) in podocytes is complicated. A thorough understanding of 
      GSK-3β is crucial to understand the mechanism of diabetic nephropathy. To analyze 
      the roles of GSK-3β in podocytes, GSK-3β knockdown lentivirus by clustered regularly 
      interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein (Cas)9 was 
      applied to establish stable cell lines. Mass spectrometry was utilized to search for 
      differentially expressed proteins. Consequently, we found 34 proteins with higher 
      levels and 115 proteins with lower levels in GSk-3β knockdown cells than in control 
      cells and identified 581 phosphosites with higher phosphorylation levels and 288 
      phosphosites with lower phosphorylation levels. We performed functional enrichment 
      analysis of these proteins and phosphorylated proteins based on public databases. 
      Enrichment analysis revealed that GSK-3β participates in the spliceosome, Hippo 
      signaling pathway, actin binding, structural molecule activity, and other pathways. 
      Then, we used motif analysis of phosphate sites to determine 89 conserved motifs 
      based on 1,068 phosphoserine (pS) sites and 15 conserved motifs in view of 104 
      phosphothreonine (pT) sites. Additionally, protein-protein interaction network 
      analysis was carried out using the STRING database. Cytoscape's add-on Molecular 
      Complex Detection (MCODE) was used to analyze key and core protein groups. In 
      quantitative differential protein analysis, four MCODEs were obtained, and 22 MCODEs 
      were obtained in the analysis of the phosphoproteome of differentially expressed 
      proteins. Finally, we analyzed the kinase regulatory network in podocytes after 
      GSK-3β knockdown and identified 299 protein kinases and 3,460 significantly changed 
      phosphorylation modification sites on 1,574 proteins. These results will be valuable 
      for further research on GSK-3β.

TI  - Analysing Parallel Strategies to Alter the Host Specificity of Bacteriophage T7.
LID - 10.3390/biology10060556 [doi]
LID - 556
AB  - The recognition and binding of host bacteria by bacteriophages is most often enabled 
      by a highly specific receptor-ligand type of interaction, with the receptor-binding 
      proteins (RBPs) of phages being the primary determinants of host specificity. 
      Specifically modifying the RBPs could alter or extend the host range of phages 
      otherwise exhibiting desired phenotypic properties. This study employed two 
      different strategies to reprogram T7 phages ordinarily infecting commensal K12 
      Escherichia coli strains to infect pathogen-associated K1-capsule-expressing 
      strains. The strategies were based on either plasmid-based homologous recombination 
      or bacteriophage recombineering using electroporated DNA (BRED). Our work pursued 
      the construction of two genetic designs: one replacing the gp17 gene of T7, the 
      other replacing gp11, gp12, and gp17 of T7 with their K1F counterparts. Both 
      strategies displayed successful integration of the K1F sequences into the T7 genome, 
      detected by PCR screening. Multiple methods were utilised to select or enrich for 
      chimeric phages incorporating the K1F gp17 alone, including trxA, host-specificity, 
      and CRISPR-Cas-based selection. Irrespective of the selection method, the above 
      strategy yielded poorly reproducible phage propagation on the new host, indicating 
      that the chimeric phage was less fit than the wild type and could not promote 
      continual autonomous reproduction. Chimeric phages obtained from BRED incorporating 
      gp11-12 and gp17, however, all displayed infection in a 2-stage pattern, indicating 
      the presence of both K1F and T7 phenotypes. This study shows that BRED can be used 
      as a tool to quickly access the potential of new RBP constructs without the need to 
      engineer sustainably replicating phages. Additionally, we show that solely 
      repurposing the primary RBP is, in some cases, insufficient to produce a viable 
      chimeric phage.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Extensive modification of genome is an efficient manner to regulate the 
      metabolic network for producing target metabolites or non-native products using 
      Corynebacterium glutamicum as a cell factory. Genome editing approaches by means of 
      homologous recombination and counter-selection markers are laborious and time 
      consuming due to multiple round manipulations and low editing efficiencies. The 
      current two-plasmid-based CRISPR-Cas9 editing methods generate false positives due 
      to the potential instability of Cas9 on the plasmid, and require a high 
      transformation efficiency for co-occurrence of two plasmids transformation. RESULTS: 
      Here, we developed a RecET-assisted CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing method using a 
      chromosome-borne Cas9-RecET and a single plasmid harboring sgRNA and repair 
      templates. The inducible expression of chromosomal RecET promoted the frequencies of 
      homologous recombination, and increased the efficiency for gene deletion. Due to the 
      high transformation efficiency of a single plasmid, this method enabled 10- and 
      20-kb region deletion, 2.5-, 5.7- and 7.5-kb expression cassette insertion and 
      precise site-specific mutation, suggesting a versatility of this method. Deletion of 
      argR and farR regulators as well as site-directed mutation of argB and pgi genes 
      generated the mutant capable of accumulating L-arginine, indicating the stability of 
      chromosome-borne Cas9 for iterative genome editing. Using this method, the 
      model-predicted target genes were modified to redirect metabolic flux towards 
      1,2-propanediol biosynthetic pathway. The final engineered strain produced 
      6.75 ± 0.46 g/L of 1,2-propanediol that is the highest titer reported in C. 
      glutamicum. Furthermore, this method is available for Corynebacterium pekinense 
      1.563, suggesting its universal applicability in other Corynebacterium species. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The RecET-assisted CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing method will facilitate 
      engineering of metabolic networks for the synthesis of interested bio-based products 
      from renewable biomass using Corynebacterium species as cell factories.

AB  - Amino acids find various applications in biotechnology in view of their importance 
      in the food, feed, pharmaceutical, and personal care industries as nutrients, 
      additives, and drugs, respectively. For the large-scale production of amino acids, 
      microbial cell factories are widely used and the development of amino acid-producing 
      strains has mainly focused on prokaryotes Corynebacterium glutamicum and Escherichia 
      coli. However, the eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae is becoming an even more 
      appealing microbial host for production of amino acids and derivatives because of 
      its superior molecular and physiological features, such as amenable to genetic 
      engineering and high tolerance to harsh conditions. To transform S. cerevisiae into 
      an industrial amino acid production platform, the highly coordinated and multiple 
      layers regulation in its amino acid metabolism should be relieved and reconstituted 
      to optimize the metabolic flux toward synthesis of target products. This chapter 
      describes principles, strategies, and applications of modular pathway rewiring in 
      yeast using the engineering of l-ornithine metabolism as a paradigm. Additionally, 
      detailed protocols for in vitro module construction and CRISPR/Cas-mediated pathway 
      assembly are provided.

AB  - Microorganisms play a crucial role in the sustainability of the various ecosystems. 
      The characterization of various interactions between microorganisms and other biotic 
      factors is a necessary footstep to understand the association and functions of 
      microbial communities. Among the different microbial interactions in an ecosystem, 
      plant-microbe interaction plays an important role to balance the ecosystem. The 
      present review explores plant-microbe interactions using gene editing and system 
      biology tools toward the comprehension in improvement of plant traits. Further, 
      system biology tools like FBA (flux balance analysis), OptKnock, and 
      constraint-based modeling helps in understanding such interactions as a whole. In 
      addition, various gene editing tools have been summarized and a strategy has been 
      hypothesized for the development of disease free plants. Furthermore, we have tried 
      to summarize the predictions through data retrieved from various types of sources 
      such as high throughput sequencing data (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphism 
      detection, RNA-seq, proteomics) and metabolic models have been reconstructed from 
      such sequences for species communities. It is well known fact that systems biology 
      approaches and modeling of biological networks will enable us to learn the insight 
      of such network and will also help further in understanding these interactions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: CRISPR-Cpf1 has recently been reported as another RNA-guided 
      endonuclease of class 2 CRISPR-Cas system, which expands the molecular biology 
      toolkit for genome editing. However, most of the online tools and applications to 
      date have been developed primarily for the Cas9. There are a limited number of tools 
      available for the Cpf1. RESULTS: We present DeepCpf1, a deep convolution neural 
      networks (CNN) approach to predict Cpf1 guide RNAs on-target activity and off-target 
      effects using their matched and mismatched DNA sequences. Trained on published data 
      sets, DeepCpf1 is superior to other machine learning algorithms and reliably 
      predicts the most efficient and less off-target effects guide RNAs for a given gene. 
      Combined with a permutation importance analysis, the key features of guide RNA 
      sequences are identified, which determine the activity and specificity of genome 
      editing. CONCLUSIONS: DeepCpf1 can significantly improve the accuracy of Cpf1-based 
      genome editing and facilitates the generation of optimized guide RNAs libraries.

AB  - Mammalian pregnancy depends on the ability of the uterus to support embryo 
      implantation. Previous studies reveal the Sox17 gene as a downstream target of the 
      Pgr-Gata2-dependent transcription network that directs genomic actions in the 
      uterine endometrium receptive for embryo implantation. Here, we report that ablating 
      Sox17 in the uterine epithelium impairs leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and Indian 
      hedgehog homolog (IHH) signaling, leading to failure of embryo implantation. In vivo 
      deletion of the SOX17-binding region 19 kb upstream of the Ihh locus by CRISPR-Cas 
      technology reduces Ihh expression specifically in the uterus and alters proper 
      endometrial epithelial-stromal interactions, thereby impairing pregnancy. This 
      SOX17-binding interval is also bound by GATA2, FOXA2, and PGR. This cluster of 
      transcription factor binding is common in 737 uterine genes and may represent a key 
      regulatory element essential for uterine epithelial gene expression.

AB  - CRISPRs (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) provide bacteria 
      and archaea with RNA-guided acquired immunity to invasive DNAs. CRISPR-associated 
      (Cas) proteins carry out the immune effector functions. Cas2 is a universal 
      component of the CRISPR system. Here, a 1.35 Å resolution crystal structure of Cas2 
      from the bacterium Desulfovibrio vulgaris (DvuCas2) is reported. DvuCas2 is a 
      homodimer, with each protomer consisting of an N-terminal βαββαβ ferredoxin fold 
      (amino acids 1-78) to which is appended a C-terminal segment (amino acids 79-102) 
      that includes a short 3(10)-helix and a fifth β-strand. The β5 strands align with 
      the β4 strands of the opposite protomers, resulting in two five-stranded 
      antiparallel β-sheets that form a sandwich at the dimer interface. The DvuCas2 dimer 
      is stabilized by a distinctive network of hydrophilic cross-protomer side-chain 
      interactions.

TI  - A manipulative interplay between positive and negative regulators of phytohormones: 
      A way forward for improving drought tolerance in plants.
PG  - 1269-1290
LID - 10.1111/ppl.13325 [doi]
AB  - Among different abiotic stresses, drought stress is the leading cause of impaired 
      plant growth and low productivity worldwide. It is therefore essential to understand 
      the process of drought tolerance in plants and thus to enhance drought resistance. 
      Accumulating evidence indicates that phytohormones are essential signaling molecules 
      that regulate diverse processes of plant growth and development under drought 
      stress. Plants can often respond to drought stress through a cascade of 
      phytohormones signaling as a means of plant growth regulation. Understanding 
      biosynthesis pathways and regulatory crosstalk involved in these vital compounds 
      could pave the way for improving plant drought tolerance while maintaining overall 
      plant health. In recent years, the identification of phytohormones related key 
      regulatory genes and their manipulation through state-of-the-art genome engineering 
      tools have helped to improve drought tolerance plants. To date, several genes linked 
      to phytohormones signaling networks, biosynthesis, and metabolism have been 
      described as a promising contender for engineering drought tolerance. Recent 
      advances in functional genomics have shown that enhanced expression of positive 
      regulators involved in hormone biosynthesis could better equip plants against 
      drought stress. Similarly, knocking down negative regulators of phytohormone 
      biosynthesis can also be very effective to negate the negative effects of drought on 
      plants. This review explained how manipulating positive and negative regulators of 
      phytohormone signaling could be improvised to develop future crop varieties 
      exhibiting higher drought tolerance. In addition, we also discuss the role of a 
      promising genome editing tool, CRISPR/Cas9, on phytohormone mediated plant growth 
      regulation for tackling drought stress.

TI  - Extrinsic acidosis suppresses glycolysis and migration while increasing network 
      formation in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells.

AB  - Acidosis is common among critically ill patients, but current approaches to correct 
      pH do not improve disease outcomes. During systemic acidosis, cells are either 
      passively exposed to extracellular acidosis that other cells have generated 
      (extrinsic acidosis) or they are exposed to acid that they generate and export into 
      the extracellular space (intrinsic acidosis). Although endothelial repair following 
      intrinsic acidosis has been studied, the impact of extrinsic acidosis on migration 
      and angiogenesis is unclear. We hypothesized that extrinsic acidosis inhibits 
      metabolism and migration but promotes capillary-like network formation in pulmonary 
      microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs). Extrinsic acidosis was modeled by 
      titrating media pH. Two types of intrinsic acidosis were compared, including 
      increasing cellular metabolism by chemically inhibiting carbonic anhydrases (CAs) IX 
      and XII (SLC-0111) and with hypoxia. PMVECs maintained baseline intracellular pH for 
      24 h with both extrinsic and intrinsic acidosis. Whole cell CA IX protein expression 
      was decreased by extrinsic acidosis but not affected by hypoxia. When extracellular 
      pH was equally acidic, extrinsic acidosis suppressed glycolysis, whereas intrinsic 
      acidosis did not. Extrinsic acidosis suppressed migration, but increased Matrigel 
      network master junction and total segment length. CRISPR-Cas9 CA IX knockout PMVECs 
      revealed an independent role of CA IX in promoting glycolysis, as loss of CA IX 
      alone was accompanied by decreased hexokinase I and pyruvate dehydrogenase E1α 
      expression and decreasing migration. 2-deoxy-d-glucose had no effect on migration 
      but profoundly inhibited network formation and increased N-cadherin expression. 
      Thus, we report that while extrinsic acidosis suppresses endothelial glycolysis and 
      migration, it promotes network formation.

TI  - Enhanced Bioreduction of Radionuclides by Driving Microbial Extracellular Electron 
      Pumping with an Engineered CRISPR Platform.
PG  - 11997-12008
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.1c03713 [doi]
AB  - Dissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria (DMRB) with extracellular electron transfer 
      (EET) capability show great potential in bioremediating the subsurface environments 
      contaminated by uranium through bioreduction and precipitation of hexavalent uranium 
      [U(VI)]. However, the low EET efficiency of DMRB remains a bottleneck for their 
      applications. Herein, we develop an engineered CRISPR platform to drive the 
      extracellular electron pumping of Shewanella oneidensis, a representative DMRB 
      species widely present in aquatic environments. The CRISPR platform allows for 
      highly efficient and multiplex genome editing and rapid platform elimination 
      post-editing in S. oneidensis. Enabled by such a platform, a genomic promoter 
      engineering strategy (GPS) for genome-widely engineering the EET-encoding gene 
      network was established. The production of electron conductive Mtr complex, 
      synthesis of electron shuttle flavin, and generation of NADH as intracellular 
      electron carrier are globally optimized and promoted, leading to a significantly 
      enhanced EET ability. Applied to U(VI) bioreduction, the edited strains achieve up 
      to 3.62-fold higher reduction capacity over the control. Our work endows DMRB with 
      an enhanced ability to remediate the radionuclides-contaminated environments and 
      provides a gene editing approach to handle the growing environmental challenges of 
      radionuclide contaminations.

TI  - Identification of an emphysema-associated genetic variant near TGFB2 with regulatory 
      effects in lung fibroblasts.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.42720 [doi]
LID - e42720
AB  - Murine studies have linked TGF-β signaling to emphysema, and human genome-wide 
      association studies (GWAS) studies of lung function and COPD have identified 
      associated regions near genes in the TGF-β superfamily. However, the functional 
      regulatory mechanisms at these loci have not been identified. We performed the 
      largest GWAS of emphysema patterns to date, identifying 10 GWAS loci including an 
      association peak spanning a 200 kb region downstream from TGFB2. Integrative 
      analysis of publicly available eQTL, DNaseI, and chromatin conformation data 
      identified a putative functional variant, rs1690789, that may regulate TGFB2 
      expression in human fibroblasts. Using chromatin conformation capture, we confirmed 
      that the region containing rs1690789 contacts the TGFB2 promoter in fibroblasts, and 
      CRISPR/Cas-9 targeted deletion of a ~ 100 bp region containing rs1690789 resulted in 
      decreased TGFB2 expression in primary human lung fibroblasts. These data provide 
      novel mechanistic evidence linking genetic variation affecting the TGF-β pathway to 
      emphysema in humans.

TI  - An Interplay between Viruses and Bacteria Associated with the White Sea Sponges 
      Revealed by Metagenomics.
LID - 10.3390/life12010025 [doi]
LID - 25
AB  - Sponges are remarkable holobionts harboring extremely diverse microbial and viral 
      communities. However, the interactions between the components within holobionts and 
      between a holobiont and environment are largely unknown, especially for polar 
      organisms. To investigate possible interactions within and between sponge-associated 
      communities, we probed the microbiomes and viromes of cold-water sympatric sponges 
      Isodictya palmata (n = 2), Halichondria panicea (n = 3), and Halichondria sitiens (n 
      = 3) by 16S and shotgun metagenomics. We showed that the bacterial and viral 
      communities associated with these White Sea sponges are species-specific and 
      different from the surrounding water. Extensive mining of bacterial antiphage 
      defense systems in the metagenomes revealed a variety of defense mechanisms. The 
      abundance of defense systems was comparable in the metagenomes of the sponges and 
      the surrounding water, thus distinguishing the White Sea sponges from those 
      inhabiting the tropical seas. We developed a network-based approach for the combined 
      analysis of CRISPR-spacers and protospacers. Using this approach, we showed that the 
      virus-host interactions within the sponge-associated community are typically more 
      abundant (three out of four interactions studied) than the inter-community 
      interactions. Additionally, we detected the occurrence of viral exchanges between 
      the communities. Our work provides the first insight into the metagenomics of the 
      three cold-water sponge species from the White Sea and paves the way for a 
      comprehensive analysis of the interactions between microbial communities and 
      associated viruses.

TI  - Lysogeny is prevalent and widely distributed in the murine gut microbiota.
PG  - 1127-1141
LID - 10.1038/s41396-018-0061-9 [doi]
AB  - Bacteriophages are central members and potential modulators of the gut microbiome; 
      however, the ecological and evolutionary relationships of gut bacteria and phages 
      are poorly understood. Here we investigated the abundance and diversity of lysogenic 
      bacteria (lysogens) in the bacterial community of C57BL/6J mice by detecting 
      integrated prophages in genomes reconstructed from the metagenome of commensal 
      bacteria. For the activities of lysogens and prophages, we compared the prophage 
      genomes with the metagenome of free phages. The majority of commensal bacteria in 
      different taxa were identified as lysogens. More lysogens were found among 
      Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, than among Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. The 
      prophage genomes shared high sequence similarity with the metagenome of free phages, 
      indicating that most lysogens appeared to be active, and that prophages are 
      spontaneously induced as active phages; dietary interventions changed the 
      composition of the induced prophages. By contrast, CRISPR-Cas systems were present 
      in few commensal bacteria, and were rarely active against gut phages. The structure 
      of the bacteria-phage infection networks was "nested-modular", with modularity 
      emerging across taxonomic scales, indicating that temperate phage features have 
      developed over a long phylogenetic timescale. We concluded that phage generalists 
      contribute to the prevalence of lysogeny in the gut ecosystem.

AB  - Bacteriophages express proteins that inactivate the CRISPR-Cas bacterial immune 
      system. Here we report the crystal structure of the anti-CRISPR protein AcrF3 in 
      complex with Pseudomonas aeruginosa Cas3 (PaCas3). AcrF3 forms a homodimer that 
      locks PaCas3 in an ADP-bound form, blocks the entrance of the DNA-binding tunnel in 
      the helicase domain, and masks the linker region and C-terminal domain of PaCas3, 
      thereby preventing recruitment by Cascade and inhibiting the type I-F CRISPR-Cas 
      system.

TI  - Circularly permuted LOV2 as a modular photoswitch for optogenetic engineering.
PG  - 915-923
LID - 10.1038/s41589-021-00792-9 [doi]
AB  - Plant-based photosensors, such as the light-oxygen-voltage sensing domain 2 (LOV2) 
      from oat phototropin 1, can be modularly wired into cell signaling networks to 
      remotely control protein activity and physiological processes. However, the 
      applicability of LOV2 is hampered by the limited choice of available caging surfaces 
      and its preference to accommodate the effector domains downstream of the C-terminal 
      Jα helix. Here, we engineered a set of LOV2 circular permutants (cpLOV2) with 
      additional caging capabilities, thereby expanding the repertoire of genetically 
      encoded photoswitches to accelerate the design of optogenetic devices. We 
      demonstrate the use of cpLOV2-based optogenetic tools to reversibly gate ion 
      channels, antagonize CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome engineering, control protein 
      subcellular localization, reprogram transcriptional outputs, elicit cell suicide and 
      generate photoactivatable chimeric antigen receptor T cells for inducible tumor cell 
      killing. Our approach is widely applicable for engineering other photoreceptors to 
      meet the growing need of optogenetic tools tailored for biomedical and 
      biotechnological applications.

      Exposure to Tetracycline.
LID - 10.1128/AEM.01999-18 [doi]
LID - e01999-18
AB  - Commercial probiotic bacteria must be tested for acquired antibiotic resistance 
      elements to avoid potential transfer to pathogens. The European Food Safety 
      Authority recommends testing resistance using microdilution culture techniques 
      previously used to establish inhibitory thresholds for the Bifidobacterium genus. 
      Many Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis strains exhibit increased resistance to 
      tetracycline, historically attributed to the ribosomal protection gene tet(W). 
      However, some strains that harbor genetically identical tet(W) genes show various 
      inhibition levels, suggesting that other genetic elements also contribute to 
      observed differences. Here, we adapted several molecular assays to confirm the 
      inhibition of B. animalis subsp. lactis strains Bl-04 and HN019 and employed RNA 
      sequencing to assess the transcriptional differences related to genomic 
      polymorphisms. We detected specific stress responses to the antibiotic by 
      correlating ATP concentration to number of viable genome copies from droplet digital 
      PCR and found that the bacteria were still metabolically active in high drug 
      concentrations. Transcriptional analyses revealed that several polymorphic regions, 
      particularly a novel multidrug efflux transporter, were differentially expressed 
      between the strains in each experimental condition, likely having phenotypic 
      effects. We also found that the tet(W) gene was upregulated only during 
      subinhibitory tetracycline concentrations, while two novel tetracycline resistance 
      genes were upregulated at high concentrations. Furthermore, many genes involved in 
      amino acid metabolism and transporter function were upregulated, while genes for 
      complex carbohydrate utilization, protein metabolism, and clustered regularly 
      interspaced short palindromic repeat(s) (CRISPR)-Cas systems were downregulated. 
      These results provide high-throughput means for assessing antibiotic resistances of 
      two highly related probiotic strains and determine the genetic network that 
      contributes to the global tetracycline response.IMPORTANCE Bifidobacterium animalis 
      subsp. lactis is widely used in human food and dietary supplements. Although well 
      documented to be safe, B. animalis subsp. lactis strains must not contain 
      transferable antibiotic resistance elements. Many B. animalis subsp. lactis strains 
      have different resistance measurements despite being genetically similar, and the 
      reasons for this are not well understood. In the current study, we sought to examine 
      how genomic differences between two closely related industrial B. animalis subsp. 
      lactis strains contribute to different resistance levels. This will lead to a better 
      understanding of resistance, identify future targets for analysis of 
      transferability, and expand our understanding of tetracycline resistance in 
      bacteria.

AB  - Programmable and precise regulation of dCas9 functions in response to multiple 
      molecular signals by using synthetic gene circuits will expand the application of 
      the CRISPR-Cas technology. However, the application of CRISPR-Cas therapeutic 
      circuits is still challenging due to the restrictive cargo size of existing viral 
      delivery vehicles. Here, we construct logic AND circuits by integrating multiple 
      split dCas9 domains, which is useful to reduce the size of synthetic circuits. In 
      addition, we engineer sensory switches by exchanging split dCas9 domains, allowing 
      differential regulations on one gene, or activating two different genes in response 
      to cell-type specific microRNAs. Therefore, we provide a valuable split-dCas9 
      toolkit to engineer complex transcription controls, which may inspire new biomedical 
      applications.

AB  - Tuberous sclerosis complex subunit 1 (TSC1) and 2 (TSC2) are frequently mutated in 
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), however, their effects on antitumor immunity 
      remained unexplored. A CRISPR screening in murine Kras(G12D)/Trp53(-/-) (KP) model 
      identified Tsc1 and Tsc2 as potent regulators of programmed cell death ligand 1 
      (Pd-l1) expression in vitro and sensitivity to anti-programmed cell death receptor 1 
      (PD-1) treatment in vivo. TSC1 or TSC2 knockout (KO) promoted the transcriptional 
      and membrane expression of PD-L1 in cell lines. TSC2-deficient tumors manifested an 
      inflamed microenvironment in patient samples and The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset. In 
      syngeneic murine models, KP-Tsc2-KO tumors showed notable response to anti-PD-1 
      antibody treatment, but Tsc2-wild-type tumors did not. Patients with 
      TSC1/TSC2-mutant NSCLC receiving immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) had increased 
      durable clinical benefit and survival. Collectively, TSC1/TSC2 loss defines a 
      distinct subtype of NSCLC characterized as inflamed tumor microenvironment and 
      superior sensitivity to ICB.

TI  - Genome analysis of lactic acid bacterial strains selected as potential starters for 
      traditional Slovakian bryndza cheese.
LID - 10.1093/femsle/fny257 [doi]
AB  - Genomes of 21 strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Slovakian traditional 
      cheeses were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform. Subsequently, they were 
      analysed regarding taxonomic classification, presence of genes encoding defence 
      systems, antibiotic resistance and production of biogenic amines. Thirteen strains 
      were found to carry genes encoding at least one bacteriocin, 18 carried genes 
      encoding at least one restriction-modification system, all strains carried 1-6 
      prophages and 9 strains had CRISPR-Cas systems. CRISPR-Cas type II-A was the most 
      common, containing 0-24 spacers. Only 10% spacers were found to be homological to 
      known bacteriophage or plasmid sequences in databases. Two Enterococcus faecium 
      strains and a Lactococcus lactis strain carried antibiotic resistance genes. Genes 
      encoding for ornithine decarboxylase were detected in four strains and genes 
      encoding for agmatine deiminase were detected in four strains. Lactobacillus 
      paraplantarum 251 L appeared to be the most interesting strain, as it contained 
      genes encoding for two bacteriocins, a restriction-modification system, two 
      CRISPR-Cas systems, four prophages and no genes connected with antibiotic resistance 
      or production of biogenic amines.

AB  - RNA splicing is a critical mechanism by which to modify transcriptome, and its 
      dysregulation is the underlying cause of many human diseases. It remains 
      challenging, however, to genetically modulate a splicing event in its native 
      context. Here, we demonstrate that a CRISPR-guided cytidine deaminase (i.e., 
      targeted-AID mediated mutagenesis [TAM]) can efficiently modulate various forms of 
      mRNA splicing. By converting invariant guanines to adenines at either 5' or 3' 
      splice sites (SS), TAM induces exon skipping, activation of alternative SS, 
      switching between mutually exclusive exons, or targeted intron retention. 
      Conversely, TAM promotes downstream exon inclusion by mutating cytidines into 
      thymines at the polypyrimidine tract. Applying this approach, we genetically 
      restored the open reading frame and dystrophin function of a mutant DMD gene in 
      patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Thus, the CRISPR-guided 
      cytidine deaminase provides a versatile genetic platform to modulate RNA splicing 
      and to correct mutations associated with aberrant splicing in human diseases.

      of proteins, and it is attracting attention as a chassis cell factory for production 
      of chemicals. However, the lack of synthetic biology tools makes it challenging in 
      rewiring P. pastoris metabolism. We here extensively engineered the recombination 
      machinery by establishing a CRISPR-Cas9 based genome editing platform, which 
      improved the homologous recombination (HR) efficiency by more than 54 times, in 
      particular, enhanced the simultaneously assembly of multiple fragments by 13.5 
      times. We also found that the key HR-relating gene RAD52 of P. pastoris was largely 
      repressed in compared to that of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This gene editing system 
      enabled efficient seamless gene disruption, genome integration and multiple gene 
      assembly with positive rates of 68-90%. With this efficient genome editing platform, 
      we characterized 46 potential genome integration sites and 18 promoters at different 
      growth conditions. This library of neutral sites and promoters enabled two-factorial 
      regulation of gene expression and metabolic pathways and resulted in a 30-fold range 
      of fatty alcohol production (12.6-380 mg/l). The expanding genetic toolbox will 
      facilitate extensive rewiring of P. pastoris for chemical production, and also shed 
      light on engineering of other non-conventional yeasts.

AB  - Monogenic mutations in the SHANK3 gene, which encodes a postsynaptic scaffold 
      protein, play a causative role in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although a number 
      of mouse models with Shank3 mutations have been valuable for investigating the 
      pathogenesis of ASD, species-dependent differences in behaviors and brain structures 
      post considerable challenges to use small animals to model ASD and to translate 
      experimental therapeutics to the clinic. We have used clustered regularly 
      interspersed short palindromic repeat/CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 to generate a 
      cynomolgus monkey model by disrupting SHANK3 at exons 6 and 12. Analysis of the live 
      mutant monkey revealed the core behavioral abnormalities of ASD, including impaired 
      social interaction and repetitive behaviors, and reduced brain network activities 
      detected by positron-emission computed tomography (PET). Importantly, these abnormal 
      behaviors and brain activities were alleviated by the antidepressant fluoxetine 
      treatment. Our findings provide the first demonstration that the genetically 
      modified non-human primate can be used for translational research of therapeutics 
      for ASD.

AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus is a lactic acid bacterium widely used in the syntrophic 
      fermentation of milk into yogurt and cheese. Streptococcus thermophilus has adapted 
      to ferment milk primarily through reductive genome evolution but also through 
      acquisition of genes conferring proto-cooperation with Lactobacillus bulgaricus and 
      efficient metabolism of milk macronutrients. Genomic analysis of Strep. thermophilus 
      strains suggests that mobile genetic elements have contributed to genomic evolution 
      through horizontal gene transfer and genomic plasticity. We previously used the 
      endogenous type II CRISPR-Cas [clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic 
      repeats (CRISPR) with CRISPR-associated sequences (Cas)] system in Strep. 
      thermophilus to isolate derivatives lacking the chromosomal mobile genetic element 
      and expandable island that display decreased fitness under routine culturing 
      conditions. Of note, the Lac operon and Leloir pathway genes were deleted in the 
      largest expendable genomic island (102 kbp), rendering the strain incapable of 
      acidifying milk. However, the removal of other open reading frames in the same 
      island had unclear effects on the fitness and regulatory networks of Strep. 
      thermophilus. To uncover the physiological basis for the observed phenotypic changes 
      and underlying regulatory networks affected by deletion of the 102-kbp genomic 
      island in Strep. thermophilus, we analyzed the transcriptome of the mutant that 
      lacked ∼5% of its genome. In addition to the loss of transcripts encoded by the 
      deleted material, we detected a total of 56 genes that were differentially 
      expressed, primarily encompassing 10 select operons. Several predicted metabolic 
      pathways were affected, including amino acid and purine metabolism, oligopeptide 
      transport, and iron transport. Collectively, these results suggest that deletion of 
      a 102-kb genomic island in Strep. thermophilus influences compensatory transcription 
      of starvation stress response genes and metabolic pathways involved in important 
      niche-related adaptation.

AB  - Cyclic di- and linear oligo-nucleotide signals activate defenses against invasive 
      nucleic acids in animal immunity; however, their evolutionary antecedents are poorly 
      understood. Using comparative genomics, sequence and structure analysis, we 
      uncovered a vast network of systems defined by conserved prokaryotic 
      gene-neighborhoods, which encode enzymes generating such nucleotides or 
      alternatively processing them to yield potential signaling molecules. The 
      nucleotide-generating enzymes include several clades of the DNA-polymerase β-like 
      superfamily (including Vibrio cholerae DncV), a minimal version of the CRISPR 
      polymerase and DisA-like cyclic-di-AMP synthetases. Nucleotide-binding/processing 
      domains include TIR domains and members of a superfamily prototyped by Smf/DprA 
      proteins and base (cytokinin)-releasing LOG enzymes. They are combined in conserved 
      gene-neighborhoods with genes for a plethora of protein superfamilies, which we 
      predict to function as nucleotide-sensors and effectors targeting nucleic acids, 
      proteins or membranes (pore-forming agents). These systems are sometimes combined 
      with other biological conflict-systems such as restriction-modification and 
      CRISPR/Cas. Interestingly, several are coupled in mutually exclusive neighborhoods 
      with either a prokaryotic ubiquitin-system or a HORMA domain-PCH2-like AAA+ ATPase 
      dyad. The latter are potential precursors of equivalent proteins in eukaryotic 
      chromosome dynamics. Further, components from these nucleotide-centric systems have 
      been utilized in several other systems including a novel diversity-generating system 
      with a reverse transcriptase. We also found the Smf/DprA/LOG domain from these 
      systems to be recruited as a predicted nucleotide-binding domain in eukaryotic TRPM 
      channels. These findings point to evolutionary and mechanistic links, which bring 
      together CRISPR/Cas, animal interferon-induced immunity, and several other systems 
      that combine nucleic-acid-sensing and nucleotide-dependent signaling.

AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum is a potential starter and health-promoting probiotic 
      bacterium. Effective, precise, and diverse genome editing of Lactobacillus plantarum 
      without introducing exogenous genes or plasmids is of great importance. In this 
      study, CRISPR/Cas9-assisted double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and single-stranded DNA 
      (ssDNA) recombineering was established in L. plantarum WCFS1 to seamlessly edit the 
      genome, including gene knockouts, insertions, and point mutations. To optimize our 
      editing method, phosphorothioate modification was used to improve the dsDNA 
      insertion, and adenine-specific methyltransferase was used to improve the ssDNA 
      recombination efficiency. These strategies were applied to engineer L. plantarum 
      WCFS1 toward producing N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). nagB was truncated to eliminate 
      the reverse reaction of fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) to glucosamine 6-phosphate 
      (GlcN-6P). Riboswitch replacement and point mutation in glmS1 were introduced to 
      relieve feedback repression. The resulting strain produced 797.3 mg/liter GlcNAc 
      without introducing exogenous genes or plasmids. This strategy may contribute to the 
      available methods for precise and diverse genetic engineering in lactic acid 
      bacteria and boost strain engineering for more applications.IMPORTANCE 
      CRISPR/Cas9-assisted recombineering is restricted in lactic acid bacteria because of 
      the lack of available antibiotics and vectors. In this study, a seamless genome 
      editing method was carried out in Lactobacillus plantarum using CRISPR/Cas9-assisted 
      double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) recombineering, and 
      recombination efficiency was effectively improved by endogenous adenine-specific 
      methyltransferase overexpression. L. plantarum WCFS1 produced 797.3 mg/liter 
      N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) through reinforcement of the GlcNAc pathway, without 
      introducing exogenous genes or plasmids. This seamless editing strategy, combined 
      with the potential exogenous GlcNAc-producing pathway, makes this strain an 
      attractive candidate for industrial use in the future.

TI  - HnRNPA2B1 promotes the proliferation of breast cancer MCF-7 cells via the STAT3 
      pathway.
PG  - 472-484
LID - 10.1002/jcb.29875 [doi]
AB  - HnRNPA2/B1 is highly expressed in many tumors. However, the role of hnRNPA2/B1 in 
      breast cancer is not clear. In this study, we found the proliferation rate was 
      decreased after knockout of hnRNPA2/B1 by CRISPR-CAS9 in MCF-7 cells, as 
      demonstrated by the reduced expression of CDK4 and p-AKT, and the increased 
      expression of P27. Besides this, the western blot results showed that knockout of 
      hnRNPA2/B1 increased the rate of apoptosis and declined autophagy. By in vivo assay, 
      we found that knockout of hnRNPA2/B1 suppressed tumor growth in a xenograft mouse 
      model. Immunohistochemical staining results confirmed knockout of hnRNPA2/B1 
      impaired tumor angiogenesis, as illustrated by downregulated expression of VEGF-A. 
      Besides this, interacting proteins with hnRNPA2/B1 were identified by mass 
      spectrometry and the PPI network was constructed. GO analysis suggests that the 
      Interacting proteins are mainly enriched in the Wnt signaling pathway, tumor 
      necrosis factor-mediated signaling pathway, translation, and so on. We then 
      identified hnRNPA2/B1 interacted with signal transducer and activator of 
      transcription 3 (STAT3), as supported by the colocalization of hnRNPA2/B1 and STAT3. 
      Meanwhile, knockout of hnRNPA2/B1 inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT3. 
      Collectively, our results demonstrate that hnRNPA2/B1 promotes tumor cell growth in 
      vitro and in vivo by activating the STAT3 pathway, regulating apoptosis and 
      autophagy.

TI  - Attitudes of Indonesian Medical Doctors and Medical Students Toward Genome Editing.
PG  - 1017-1027
LID - 10.2147/JMDH.S303881 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to measure the attitudes of Indonesian medical doctors and 
      students toward new technology in genome editing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Online 
      questionnaires regarding attitudes toward genome editing on health and non-health 
      conditions, both in somatic cells and embryo, were distributed through researcher 
      networks, email and social media specific to medical doctors and students. The data 
      of 1055 valid questionnaires were processed; descriptive and association analyses 
      between sociodemographic factors and attitudes toward genome editing were performed. 
      Email in-depth interview was performed to explore the respondents' answers. RESULTS: 
      The results showed that Indonesian medical doctors' and students' knowledge of 
      genome editing was limited and correlated with gender, place of residence, religion, 
      education, marital status, childbearing and experience abroad. More than half of 
      respondents supported genome editing for the treatment of fatal and debilitating 
      diseases both in somatic cells and embryos, implying their consent to edited gene 
      inheritance. However, this approval decreased when applied to non-health-related 
      aspects, such as physical appearance, intelligence and strength. Factors affecting 
      their attitudes toward genome editing included their status as medical doctors or 
      students, gender, age, education, religion, economic status and place of residence. 
      CONCLUSION: Increasing knowledge and awareness of Indonesian medical doctors and 
      students regarding genome editing is important. Even though its application in 
      health-related matter was supported by a majority of the respondents, discussion 
      from ethical and religious perspectives is necessary to ensure the acceptance.

TI  - Genome-Resolved Metagenomics Extends the Environmental Distribution of the 
      Verrucomicrobia Phylum to the Deep Terrestrial Subsurface.
LID - 10.1128/mSphere.00613-19 [doi]
LID - e00613-19
AB  - Bacteria of the phylum Verrucomicrobia are prevalent and are particularly common in 
      soil and freshwater environments. Their cosmopolitan distribution and reported 
      capacity for polysaccharide degradation suggests members of Verrucomicrobia are 
      important contributors to carbon cycling across Earth's ecosystems. Despite their 
      prevalence, the Verrucomicrobia are underrepresented in isolate collections and 
      genome databases; consequently, their ecophysiological roles may not be fully 
      realized. Here, we expand genomic sampling of the Verrucomicrobia phylum by 
      describing a novel genus, "Candidatus Marcellius," belonging to the order Opitutales 
      "Ca. Marcellius" was recovered from a shale-derived produced fluid metagenome 
      collected 313 days after hydraulic fracturing, the deepest environment from which a 
      member of the Verrucomicrobia has been recovered to date. We uncover genomic 
      attributes that may explain the capacity of this organism to inhabit a shale gas 
      well, including the potential for utilization of organic polymers common in 
      hydraulic fracturing fluids, nitrogen fixation, adaptation to high salinities, and 
      adaptive immunity via CRISPR-Cas. To illuminate the phylogenetic and environmental 
      distribution of these metabolic and adaptive traits across the Verrucomicrobia 
      phylum, we performed a comparative genomic analysis of 31 publicly available, nearly 
      complete Verrucomicrobia genomes. Our genomic findings extend the environmental 
      distribution of the Verrucomicrobia 2.3 kilometers into the terrestrial subsurface. 
      Moreover, we reveal traits widely encoded across members of the Verrucomicrobia, 
      including the capacity to degrade hemicellulose and to adapt to physical and 
      biological environmental perturbations, thereby contributing to the expansive 
      habitat range reported for this phylum.IMPORTANCE The Verrucomicrobia phylum of 
      bacteria is widespread in many different ecosystems; however, its role in microbial 
      communities remains poorly understood. Verrucomicrobia are often low-abundance 
      community members, yet previous research suggests they play a major role in organic 
      carbon degradation. While Verrucomicrobia remain poorly represented in culture 
      collections, numerous genomes have been reconstructed from metagenomic data sets in 
      recent years. The study of genomes from across the phylum allows for an extensive 
      assessment of their potential ecosystem roles. The significance of this work is (i) 
      the recovery of a novel genus of Verrucomicrobia from 2.3 km in the subsurface with 
      the ability to withstand the extreme conditions that characterize this environment, 
      and (ii) the most extensive assessment of ecophysiological traits encoded by 
      Verrucomicrobia genomes to date. We show that members of this phylum are specialist 
      organic polymer degraders that can withstand a wider range of environmental 
      conditions than previously thought.

TI  - OsmiR396/growth regulating factor modulate rice grain size through direct regulation 
      of embryo-specific miR408.
PG  - 519-533
LID - 10.1093/plphys/kiab084 [doi]
AB  - microRNAs (miRNAs) are promising targets for crop improvement of complex 
      agricultural traits. Coordinated activity between/among different miRNAs may 
      fine-tune specific developmental processes in diverse organisms. Grain size is a 
      main factor determining rice (Oryza sativa L.) crop yield, but the network of miRNAs 
      influencing this trait remains uncharacterized. Here we show that sequestering 
      OsmiR396 through target mimicry (MIM396) can substantially increase grain size in 
      several japonica and indica rice subspecies and in plants with excessive tillers and 
      a high panicle density. Thus, OsmiR396 has a major role related to the regulation of 
      rice grain size. The grain shape of Growth Regulating Factor8 
      (OsGRF8)-overexpressing transgenic plants was most similar to that of MIM396 plants, 
      suggesting OsGRF8 is a major mediator of OsmiR396 in grain size regulation. A miRNA 
      microarray analysis revealed changes to the expression of many miRNAs, including 
      OsmiR408, in the MIM396 plants. Analyses of gene expression patterns and functions 
      indicated OsmiR408 is an embryo-specific miRNA that positively regulates grain size. 
      Silencing OsmiR408 expression (miR408KO) using CRISPR technology resulted in small 
      grains. Moreover, we revealed the direct regulatory effects of OsGRF8 on OsMIR408 
      expression. A genetic analysis further showed that the large-grain phenotype of 
      MIM396 plants could be complemented by miR408KO. Also, several hormone signaling 
      pathways might be involved in the OsmiR396/GRF-meditated grain size regulation. Our 
      findings suggest that genetic regulatory networks comprising various miRNAs, such as 
      OsmiR396 and OsmiR408, may be crucial for controlling rice grain size. Furthermore, 
      the OsmiR396/GRF module may be important for breeding new high-yielding rice 
      varieties.

TI  - Molecular Titration Promotes Oscillations and Bistability in Minimal Network Models 
      with Monomeric Regulators.

LID - 10.1021/acssynbio.5b00176 [doi]
AB  - Molecular titration is emerging as an important biochemical interaction mechanism 
      within synthetic devices built with nucleic acids and the CRISPR/Cas system. We show 
      that molecular titration in the context of feedback circuits is a suitable mechanism 
      to enhance the emergence of oscillations and bistable behaviors. We consider 
      biomolecular modules that can be inhibited or activated by input monomeric 
      regulators; the regulators compete with constitutive titrating species to determine 
      the activity of their target. By tuning the titration rate and the concentration of 
      titrating species, it is possible to modulate the delay and convergence speed of the 
      transient response, and the steepness and dead zone of the stationary response of 
      the modules. These phenomena favor the occurrence of oscillations when modules are 
      interconnected to create a negative feedback loop; bistability is favored in a 
      positive feedback interconnection. Numerical simulations are supported by 
      mathematical analysis showing that the capacity of the closed loop systems to 
      exhibit oscillations or bistability is structural.

TI  - FGF10 and the Mystery of Duodenal Atresia in Humans.
PG  - 530
LID - 10.3389/fgene.2018.00530 [doi]
LID - 530
AB  - Background: Duodenal atresia (DA) is a congenital obstruction of the duodenum, which 
      affects 1 in 7000 pregnancies and requires major surgery in the 1st days of life. 
      Three morphological DA types are described. In humans, the association between DA 
      and Down syndrome suggests an underlying, albeit elusive, genetic etiology. In mice, 
      interruption of fibroblast growth factor 10 (Fgf10) gene signaling results in DA in 
      30-50% of embryos, supporting a genetic etiology. This study aims to validate the 
      spectrum of DA in two novel strains of Fgf10 knock-out mice, in preparation for 
      future and translational research. Methods: Two novel CRISPR Fgf10 knock-out mouse 
      strains were derived and embryos generated by heterozygous plug-mating. E15.5-E19.5 
      embryos were genotyped with respect to Fgf10 and micro-dissected to determine the 
      presence and type of DA. Results: One twenty seven embryos (32 wild-type, 34 
      heterozygous, 61 null) were analyzed. No wild-type or heterozygous embryos had DA. 
      However, 74% of Fgf10 null embryos had DA (49% type 1, 18% type 2, and 33% type 3). 
      Conclusion: Our CRISPR-derived strains showed higher penetrance of DA due to 
      single-gene deletion of Fgf10 in mice than previously reported. Further, the DA type 
      distribution in these mice more closely reiterated that observed in humans. Future 
      experiments will document RNA and protein expression of FGF10 and its key downstream 
      signaling targets in normal and atretic duodenum. This includes exploitation of 
      modern, high-fidelity developmental tools, e.g., Fgf10 (flox/+)-tomato(flox/flox) 
      mice.

TI  - Efficient increase of ɣ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) content in tomato fruits by 
      targeted mutagenesis.

AB  - γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a non-proteinogenic amino acid that has hypotensive 
      effects. Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) is among the most widely cultivated and 
      consumed vegetables in the world and contains higher levels of GABA than other major 
      crops. Increasing these levels can further enhance the blood pressure-lowering 
      function of tomato fruit. Glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) is a key enzyme in GABA 
      biosynthesis; it has a C-terminal autoinhibitory domain that regulates enzymatic 
      function, and deleting this domain increases GAD activity. The tomato genome has 
      five GAD genes (SlGAD1-5), of which two (SlGAD2 and SlGAD3) are expressed during 
      tomato fruit development. To increase GABA content in tomato, we deleted the 
      autoinhibitory domain of SlGAD2 and SlGAD3 using clustered regularly interspaced 
      short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein (Cas)9 technology. 
      Introducing a stop codon immediately before the autoinhibitory domain increased GABA 
      accumulation by 7 to 15 fold while having variable effects on plant and fruit size 
      and yield. This is the first study describing the application of the CRISPR/Cas9 
      system to increase GABA content in tomato fruits. Our findings provide a basis for 
      the improvement of other types of crop by CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic modification.

TI  - Mic13 Is Essential for Formation of Crista Junctions in Mammalian Cells.

LID - e0160258
AB  - Mitochondrial cristae are connected to the inner boundary membrane via crista 
      junctions which are implicated in the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation, 
      apoptosis, and import of lipids and proteins. The MICOS complex determines formation 
      of crista junctions. We performed complexome profiling and identified Mic13, also 
      termed Qil1, as a subunit of the MICOS complex. We show that MIC13 is an inner 
      membrane protein physically interacting with MIC60, a central subunit of the MICOS 
      complex. Using the CRISPR/Cas method we generated the first cell line deleted for 
      MIC13. These knockout cells show a complete loss of crista junctions demonstrating 
      that MIC13 is strictly required for the formation of crista junctions. MIC13 is 
      required for the assembly of MIC10, MIC26, and MIC27 into the MICOS complex. 
      However, it is not needed for the formation of the MIC60/MIC19/MIC25 subcomplex 
      suggesting that the latter is not sufficient for crista junction formation. MIC13 is 
      also dispensable for assembly of respiratory chain complexes and for maintaining 
      mitochondrial network morphology. Still, lack of MIC13 resulted in a moderate 
      reduction of mitochondrial respiration. In summary, we show that MIC13 has a 
      fundamental role in crista junction formation and that assembly of respiratory chain 
      supercomplexes is independent of mitochondrial cristae shape.

PG  - 87-100
LID - 10.1093/nsr/nwz002 [doi]
AB  - Circadian disruption is a risk factor for metabolic, psychiatric and age-related 
      disorders, and non-human primate models could help to develop therapeutic 
      treatments. Here, we report the generation of BMAL1 knockout cynomolgus monkeys for 
      circadian-related disorders by CRISPR/Cas9 editing of monkey embryos. These monkeys 
      showed higher nocturnal locomotion and reduced sleep, which was further exacerbated 
      by a constant light regimen. Physiological circadian disruption was reflected by the 
      markedly dampened and arrhythmic blood hormonal levels. Furthermore, BMAL1-deficient 
      monkeys exhibited anxiety and depression, consistent with their stably elevated 
      blood cortisol, and defective sensory processing in auditory oddball tests found in 
      schizophrenia patients. Ablation of BMAL1 up-regulated transcriptional programs 
      toward inflammatory and stress responses, with transcription networks associated 
      with human sleep deprivation, major depressive disorders, and aging. Thus, BMAL1 
      knockout monkeys are potentially useful for studying the physiological consequences 
      of circadian disturbance, and for developing therapies for circadian and psychiatric 
      disorders.

TI  - GRAS-domain transcription factor PAT1 regulates jasmonic acid biosynthesis in grape 
      cold stress response.
PG  - 1660-1678
LID - 10.1093/plphys/kiab142 [doi]
AB  - Cultivated grapevine (Vitis) is a highly valued horticultural crop, and cold stress 
      affects its growth and productivity. Wild Amur grape (Vitis amurensis) PAT1 
      (Phytochrome A signal transduction 1, VaPAT1) is induced by low temperature, and 
      ectopic expression of VaPAT1 enhances cold tolerance in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis 
      thaliana). However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of VaPAT1 during 
      the cold stress response in grapevine. Here, we confirmed the overexpression of 
      VaPAT1 in transformed grape calli enhanced cold tolerance. Yeast two-hybrid and 
      bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays highlighted an interaction between 
      VaPAT1 with INDETERMINATE-DOMAIN 3 (VaIDD3). A role of VaIDD3 in cold tolerance was 
      also indicated. Transcriptome analysis revealed VaPAT1 and VaIDD3 overexpression and 
      cold treatment coordinately modulate the expression of stress-related genes 
      including lipoxygenase 3 (LOX3), a gene encoding a key jasmonate biosynthesis 
      enzyme. Co-expression network analysis indicated LOX3 might be a downstream target 
      of VaPAT1. Both electrophoretic mobility shift and dual luciferase reporter assays 
      showed the VaPAT1-IDD3 complex binds to the IDD-box (AGACAAA) in the VaLOX3 promoter 
      to activate its expression. Overexpression of both VaPAT1 and VaIDD3 increased the 
      transcription of VaLOX3 and JA levels in transgenic grape calli. Conversely, 
      VaPAT1-SRDX (dominant repression) and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis of PAT1-ED 
      causing the loss of the C-terminus in grape calli dramatically prohibited the 
      accumulation of VaLOX3 and JA levels during cold treatment. Together, these findings 
      point to a pivotal role of VaPAT1 in the cold stress response in grape by regulating 
      JA biosynthesis.

TI  - Profiling the long noncoding RNA interaction network in the regulatory elements of 
      target genes by chromatin in situ reverse transcription sequencing.
PG  - 1521-1532
LID - 10.1101/gr.244996.118 [doi]
AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) can regulate the activity of target genes by 
      participating in the organization of chromatin architecture. We have devised a 
      "chromatin-RNA in situ reverse transcription sequencing" (CRIST-seq) approach to 
      profile the lncRNA interaction network in gene regulatory elements by combining the 
      simplicity of RNA biotin labeling with the specificity of the CRISPR/Cas9 system. 
      Using gene-specific gRNAs, we describe a pluripotency-specific lncRNA interacting 
      network in the promoters of Sox2 and Pou5f1, two critical stem cell factors that are 
      required for the maintenance of pluripotency. The promoter-interacting lncRNAs were 
      specifically activated during reprogramming into pluripotency. Knockdown of these 
      lncRNAs caused the stem cells to exit from pluripotency. In contrast, overexpression 
      of the pluripotency-associated lncRNA activated the promoters of core stem cell 
      factor genes and enhanced fibroblast reprogramming into pluripotency. These 
      CRIST-seq data suggest that the Sox2 and Pou5f1 promoters are organized within a 
      unique lncRNA interaction network that determines the fate of pluripotency during 
      reprogramming. This CRIST approach may be broadly used to map lncRNA interaction 
      networks at target loci across the genome.

TI  - Genomic insights into Staphylococcus equorum KS1039 as a potential starter culture

AB  - BACKGROUND: Our previous comparative genomic analysis of Staphylococcus equorum 
      KS1039 with five S. equorum strains illuminated the genomic basis of its safety and 
      salt tolerance. However, a comprehensive picture of the cellular components and 
      metabolic pathways involved in the degradation of macromolecules and development of 
      sensory properties has not been obtained for S. equorum. Therefore, in this study, 
      we examined the general metabolism of S. equorum based on information obtained from 
      published complete genome sequences of six S. equorum strains isolated from 
      different niches. Additionally, the utility of strain KS1039 as a starter culture 
      for high-salt food fermentations was examined. RESULTS: All six S. equorum strains 
      contained genes involved in glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and amino acid 
      metabolic pathways, as well as color development. Moreover, the strains had the 
      potential to produce acetoin, butanediol, and branched chain fatty acids, all of 
      which are important flavor compounds. None of the strains contained decarboxylase 
      genes, which are required for histamine and tyramine production. Strain KS1039 
      contained bacteriocin and CRISPR/Cas gene clusters, and experimental results 
      suggested that these genes were functional in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: The comparative 
      genomic analysis carried out herein provides important information on the usefulness 
      of S. equorum KS1039 as a starter culture for the fermentation of high-salt foods in 
      terms of safety, salt tolerance, bacteriocin production, and foreign plasmid 
      restriction.

TI  - Understanding the Streptococcus mutans Cid/Lrg System through CidB Function.
PG  - 6189-6203
AB  - The Streptococcus mutans lrgAB and cidAB operons have been previously described as a 
      potential model system to dissect the complexity of biofilm development and 
      virulence of S. mutans Herein, we have attempted to further characterize the Cid/Lrg 
      system by focusing on CidB, which has been shown to be critical for the ability of 
      S. mutans to survive and persist in a nonpreferred oxygen-enriched condition. We 
      have found that the expression level of cidB is critical to oxidative stress 
      tolerance of S. mutans, most likely by impacting lrg expression. Intriguingly, the 
      impaired aerobic growth phenotype of the cidB mutant could be restored by the 
      additional loss of either CidA or LrgA. Growth-dependent expression of cid and lrg 
      was demonstrated to be tightly under the control of both CcpA and the VicKR 
      two-component system (TCS), regulators known to play an essential role in 
      controlling major catabolic pathways and cell envelope homeostasis, respectively. 
      RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis revealed that mutation of cidB resulted in global 
      gene expression changes, comprising major domains of central metabolism and 
      virulence processes, particularly in those involved with oxidative stress 
      resistance. Loss of CidB also significantly changed the expression of genes related 
      to genomic islands (GI) TnSmu1 and TnSmu2, the CRISPR (clustered regularly 
      interspaced short palindromic repeats)-Cas system, and toxin-antitoxin (T/A) 
      modules. Taken together, these data show that CidB impinges on the stress response, 
      as well as the fundamental cellular physiology of S. mutans, and further suggest a 
      potential link between Cid/Lrg-mediated cellular processes, S. mutans pathogenicity, 
      and possible programmed growth arrest and cell death mechanisms. IMPORTANCE: The 
      ability of Streptococcus mutans to survive a variety of harmful or stressful 
      conditions and to emerge as a numerically significant member of stable oral biofilm 
      communities are essential elements for its persistence and cariogenicity. In this 
      study, the homologous cidAB and lrgAB operons, previously identified as being highly 
      balanced and coordinated during S. mutans aerobic growth, were further characterized 
      through the functional and transcriptomic analysis of CidB. Precise control of CidB 
      levels is shown to impact the expression of lrg, oxidative stress tolerance, major 
      metabolic domains, and the molecular modules linked to cell death and lysis. This 
      study advances our understanding of the Cid/Lrg system as a key player in the 
      integration of complex environmental signals (such as oxidative stress) into the 
      regulatory networks that modulate S. mutans virulence and cell homeostasis.

TI  - Polyvalent Proteins, a Pervasive Theme in the Intergenomic Biological Conflicts of 
      Bacteriophages and Conjugative Elements.
LID - 10.1128/JB.00245-17 [doi]
LID - e00245-17
AB  - Intense biological conflicts between prokaryotic genomes and their genomic parasites 
      have resulted in an arms race in terms of the molecular "weaponry" deployed on both 
      sides. Using a recursive computational approach, we uncovered a remarkable class of 
      multidomain proteins with 2 to 15 domains in the same polypeptide deployed by 
      viruses and plasmids in such conflicts. Domain architectures and genomic contexts 
      indicate that they are part of a widespread conflict strategy involving proteins 
      injected into the host cell along with parasite DNA during the earliest phase of 
      infection. Their unique feature is the combination of domains with highly disparate 
      biochemical activities in the same polypeptide; accordingly, we term them polyvalent 
      proteins. Of the 131 domains in polyvalent proteins, a large fraction are enzymatic 
      domains predicted to modify proteins, target nucleic acids, alter nucleotide 
      signaling/metabolism, and attack peptidoglycan or cytoskeletal components. They 
      further contain nucleic acid-binding domains, virion structural domains, and 40 
      novel uncharacterized domains. Analysis of their architectural network reveals both 
      pervasive common themes and specialized strategies for conjugative elements and 
      plasmids or (pro)phages. The themes include likely processing of multidomain 
      polypeptides by zincin-like metallopeptidases and mechanisms to counter restriction 
      or CRISPR/Cas systems and jump-start transcription or replication. DNA-binding 
      domains acquired by eukaryotes from such systems have been reused in 
      XPC/RAD4-dependent DNA repair and mitochondrial genome replication in 
      kinetoplastids. Characterization of the novel domains discovered here, such as 
      RNases and peptidases, are likely to aid in the development of new reagents and 
      elucidation of the spread of antibiotic resistance.IMPORTANCE This is the first 
      report of the widespread presence of large proteins, termed polyvalent proteins, 
      predicted to be transmitted by genomic parasites such as conjugative elements, 
      plasmids, and phages during the initial phase of infection along with their DNA. 
      They are typified by the presence of multiple domains with disparate activities 
      combined in the same protein. While some of these domains are predicted to assist 
      the invasive element in replication, transcription, or protection of their DNA, 
      several are likely to target various host defense systems or modify the host to 
      favor the parasite's life cycle. Notably, DNA-binding domains from these systems 
      have been transferred to eukaryotes, where they have been incorporated into DNA 
      repair and mitochondrial genome replication systems.

TI  - Entropic Stabilization of Cas4 Protein SSO0001 Predicted with Popcoen.
LID - 10.3390/e20080580 [doi]
LID - 580
AB  - Popcoen is a method for configurational entropy estimation of proteins based on 
      machine-learning. Entropy is predicted with an artificial neural network which was 
      trained on simulation trajectories of a large set of representative proteins. 
      Popcoen is extremely fast compared to other approaches based on the sampling of a 
      multitude of microstates. Consequently, Popcoen can be incorporated into a large 
      class of protein software which currently neglects configurational entropy for 
      performance reasons. Here, we apply Popcoen to various conformations of the Cas4 
      protein SSO0001 of Sulfolobus solfataricus, a protein that assembles to a decamer of 
      known toroidal shape. We provide numerical evidence that the native state (NAT) of a 
      SSO0001 monomer has a similar structure to the protomers of the oligomer, where NAT 
      of the monomer is stabilized mainly entropically. Due to its large amount of 
      configurational entropy, NAT has lower free energy than alternative conformations of 
      very low enthalpy and solvation free-energy. Hence, SSO0001 serves as an example 
      case where neglecting configurational entropy leads to incorrect conclusion. Our 
      results imply that no refolding of the subunits is required during oligomerization 
      which suggests that configurational entropy is employed by nature to largely enhance 
      the rate of assembly.

TI  - Modular Ligation Extension of Guide RNA Operons (LEGO) for Multiplexed dCas9 
      Regulation of Metabolic Pathways in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
PG  - e1700582
LID - 10.1002/biot.201700582 [doi]
AB  - Metabolic engineering typically utilizes a suboptimal step-wise gene target 
      optimization approach to parse a highly connected and regulated cellular metabolism. 
      While the endonuclease-null CRISPR/Cas system has enabled gene expression 
      perturbations without genetic modification, it has been mostly limited to small sets 
      of gene targets in eukaryotes due to inefficient methods to assemble and express 
      large sgRNA operons. In this work, we develop a TEF1p-tRNA expression system and 
      demonstrate that the use of tRNAs as splicing elements flanking sgRNAs provides 
      higher efficiency than both Pol III and ribozyme-based expression across a variety 
      of single sgRNA and multiplexed contexts. Next, we devise and validate a scheme to 
      allow modular construction of tRNA-sgRNA (TST) operons using an iterative Type IIs 
      digestion/ligation extension approach, termed CRISPR-Ligation Extension of sgRNA 
      Operons (LEGO). This approach enables facile construction of large TST operons. We 
      demonstrate this utility by constructing a metabolic rewiring prototype for 
      2,3-butanediol production in 2 distinct yeast strain backgrounds. These results 
      demonstrate that our approach can act as a surrogate for traditional genetic 
      modification on a much shorter design-cycle timescale.

AB  - The rat is an important animal model in biomedical research, but practical 
      limitations to genetic manipulation have restricted the application of genetic 
      analysis. Here we report the derivation of rat androgenetic haploid embryonic stem 
      cells (RahESCs) as a tool to facilitate such studies. Our approach is based on 
      removal of the maternal pronucleus from zygotes to generate androgenetic embryos 
      followed by derivation of ESCs. The resulting RahESCs have 21 chromosomes, express 
      pluripotency markers, differentiate into three germ layer cells, and contribute to 
      the germline. Homozygous mutations can be introduced by both large-scale gene 
      trapping and precise gene targeting via homologous recombination or the CRISPR-Cas 
      system. RahESCs can also produce fertile rats after intracytoplasmic injection into 
      oocytes and are therefore able to transmit genetic modifications to offspring. 
      Overall, RahESCs represent a practical tool for functional genetic studies and 
      production of transgenic lines in rat.

AB  - Maintenance of genome stability is essential for every living cell as genetic 
      information is repeatedly challenged during DNA replication in each cell division 
      event. Errors, defects, delays, and mistakes that arise during mitosis or meiosis 
      lead to an activation of DNA repair processes and in case of their failure, 
      programmed cell death, i.e. apoptosis, could be initiated. Fam208a is a protein 
      whose importance in heterochromatin maintenance has been described recently. In this 
      work, we describe the crucial role of Fam208a in sustaining the genome stability 
      during the cellular division. The targeted depletion of Fam208a in mice using 
      CRISPR/Cas9 leads to embryonic lethality before E12.5. We also used the siRNA 
      approach to downregulate Fam208a in zygotes to avoid the influence of maternal RNA 
      in the early stages of development. This early downregulation increased arresting of 
      the embryonal development at the two-cell stage and occurrence of multipolar 
      spindles formation. To investigate this further, we used the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) 
      system and identified new putative interaction partners Gpsm2, Amn1, Eml1, Svil, and 
      Itgb3bp. Their co-expression with Fam208a was assessed by qRT-PCR profiling and in 
      situ hybridisation [1] in multiple murine tissues. Based on these results we 
      proposed that Fam208a functions within the HUSH complex by interaction with Mphosph8 
      as these proteins are not only able to physically interact but also co-localise. We 
      are bringing new evidence that Fam208a is multi-interacting protein affecting genome 
      stability on the level of cell division at the earliest stages of development and 
      also by interaction with methylation complex in adult tissues. In addition to its 
      epigenetic functions, Fam208a appears to have an additional role in zygotic 
      division, possibly via interaction with newly identified putative partners Gpsm2, 
      Amn1, Eml1, Svil, and Itgb3bp.

TI  - WNT-3A-induced β-catenin signaling does not require signaling through heterotrimeric 
      G proteins.
PG  - 11677-11684
LID - 10.1074/jbc.AC119.009412 [doi]
AB  - The network of Wingless/Int-1 (WNT)-induced signaling pathways includes 
      β-catenin-dependent and -independent pathways. β-Catenin regulates T cell 
      factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (TCF/LEF)-mediated gene transcription, and 
      in response to WNTs, β-catenin signaling is initiated through engagement of a 
      Frizzled (FZD)/LDL receptor-related protein 5/6 (LRP5/6) receptor complex. FZDs are 
      G protein-coupled receptors, but the question of whether heterotrimeric G proteins 
      are involved in WNT/β-catenin signaling remains unanswered. Here, we investigate 
      whether acute activation of WNT/β-catenin signaling by purified WNT-3A requires 
      functional signaling through heterotrimeric G proteins. Using genome editing, we 
      ablated expression of G(s)/G(olf)/G(q)/G(11)/G(12)/G(13)/G(z) in HEK293 (ΔG7) cells, 
      leaving the expression of pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G(i/o) proteins unchanged, 
      to assess whether WNT-3A activates WNT/β-catenin signaling in WT and ΔG7 cells 
      devoid of functional G protein signaling. We monitored WNT-3A-induced activation by 
      detection of phosphorylation of LDL receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6), 
      electrophoretic mobility shift of the phosphoprotein Dishevelled (DVL), β-catenin 
      stabilization and dephosphorylation, and TCF-dependent transcription. We found that 
      purified, recombinant WNT-3A efficiently induces WNT/β-catenin signaling in ΔG7 
      cells in both the absence and presence of G(i/o)-blocking PTX. Furthermore, cells 
      completely devoid of G protein expression, so called Gα-depleted HEK293 cells, 
      maintain responsiveness to WNT-3A with regard to the hallmarks of WNT/β-catenin 
      signaling. These findings corroborate the concept that heterotrimeric G proteins are 
      not required for this FZD- and DVL-mediated signaling branch. Our observations agree 
      with previous results arguing for FZD conformation-dependent functional selectivity 
      between DVL and heterotrimeric G proteins. In conclusion, WNT/β-catenin signaling 
      through FZDs does not require the involvement of heterotrimeric G proteins.

TI  - A quantitative image analysis pipeline for the characterization of filamentous 
      fungal morphologies as a tool to uncover targets for morphology engineering: a case 
      study using aplD in Aspergillus niger.
PG  - 149
LID - 10.1186/s13068-019-1473-0 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fungal fermentation is used to produce a diverse repertoire of enzymes, 
      chemicals, and drugs for various industries. During submerged cultivation, 
      filamentous fungi form a range of macromorphologies, including dispersed mycelia, 
      clumped aggregates, or pellets, which have critical implications for rheological 
      aspects during fermentation, gas/nutrient transfer, and, thus, product titres. An 
      important component of strain engineering efforts is the ability to quantitatively 
      assess fungal growth phenotypes, which will drive novel leads for morphologically 
      optimized production strains. RESULTS: In this study, we developed an automated 
      image analysis pipeline to quantify the morphology of pelleted and dispersed growth 
      (MPD) which rapidly and reproducibly measures dispersed and pelleted 
      macromorphologies from any submerged fungal culture. It (i) enables capture and 
      analysis of several hundred images per user/day, (ii) is designed to quantitatively 
      assess heterogeneous cultures consisting of dispersed and pelleted forms, (iii) 
      gives a quantitative measurement of culture heterogeneity, (iv) automatically 
      generates key Euclidian parameters for individual fungal structures including 
      particle diameter, aspect ratio, area, and solidity, which are also assembled into a 
      previously described dimensionless morphology number MN, (v) has an in-built quality 
      control check which enables end-users to easily confirm the accuracy of the 
      automated calls, and (vi) is easily adaptable to user-specified magnifications and 
      macromorphological definitions. To concomitantly provide proof of principle for the 
      utility of this image analysis pipeline, and provide new leads for morphologically 
      optimized fungal strains, we generated a morphological mutant in the cell factory 
      Aspergillus niger based on CRISPR-Cas technology. First, we interrogated a 
      previously published co-expression networks for A. niger to identify a putative 
      gamma-adaptin encoding gene (aplD) that was predicted to play a role in endosome 
      cargo trafficking. Gene editing was used to generate a conditional aplD expression 
      mutant under control of the titratable Tet-on system. Reduced aplD expression caused 
      a hyperbranched growth phenotype and diverse defects in pellet formation with a 
      putative increase in protein secretion. This possible protein hypersecretion 
      phenotype could be correlated with increased dispersed mycelia, and both decreased 
      pellet diameter and MN. CONCLUSION: The MPD image analysis pipeline is a simple, 
      rapid, and flexible approach to quantify diverse fungal morphologies. As an 
      exemplar, we have demonstrated that the putative endosomal transport gene aplD plays 
      a crucial role in A. niger filamentous growth and pellet formation during submerged 
      culture. This suggests that endocytic components are underexplored targets for 
      engineering fungal cell factories.

AB  - Dravet syndrome is an epileptic encephalopathy largely due to haploinsufficiency of 
      the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.1 that is expressed primarily in GABAergic 
      neurons. In order to distinguish the different subtypes, we used gene editing to 
      introduce tdTomato gene into the genome of iPSCs to label the GABAergic neurons in 
      the differentiated neuronal networks. The gene-edited cell line demonstrates normal 
      karyotype, expresses the main pluripotency markers, and shows the presence of 
      differentiation into the three embryonic germ layers in teratomas.

PG  - 1071-1081
LID - 10.1111/tpj.13307 [doi]
AB  - Microalgae are promising feedstock for biofuels yet mechanistic probing of their 
      cellular network and industrial strain development have been hindered by lack of 
      genome-editing tools. Nannochloropsis spp. are emerging model microalgae for 
      scalable oil production and carbon sequestration. Here we established a 
      CRISPR/Cas9-based precise genome-editing approach for the industrial oleaginous 
      microalga Nannochloropsis oceanica, using nitrate reductase (NR; g7988) as example. 
      A new screening procedure that compares between restriction enzyme-digested nested 
      PCR (nPCR) products derived from enzyme-digested and not-digested genomic DNA of 
      transformant pools was developed to quickly, yet reliably, detect genome-engineered 
      mutants. Deep sequencing of nPCR products directly amplified from pooled genomic DNA 
      revealed over an 1% proportion of 5-bp deletion mutants and a lower frequency of 
      12-bp deletion mutants, with both types of editing precisely located at the targeted 
      site. The isolated mutants, in which precise deletion of five bases caused a 
      frameshift in NR translation, grow normally under NH(4) Cl but fail to grow under 
      NaNO(3) , and thus represent a valuable chassis strain for transgenic-strain 
      development. This demonstration of CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing in industrial 
      microalgae opens many doors for microalgae-based biotechnological applications.

TI  - The KBTBD6/7-DRD2 axis regulates pituitary adenoma sensitivity to dopamine agonist 
      treatment.
PG  - 377-396
LID - 10.1007/s00401-020-02180-4 [doi]
AB  - Pituitary adenoma (PA) is one of the most common intracranial tumors, and 
      approximately 40% of all PAs are prolactinomas. Dopamine agonists (DAs), such as 
      cabergoline (CAB), have been successfully used in the treatment of prolactinomas. 
      The expression of dopamine type 2 receptor (DRD2) determines the therapeutic effect 
      of DAs, but the molecular mechanisms of DRD2 regulation are not fully understood. In 
      this study, we first demonstrated that DRD2 underwent proteasome-mediated 
      degradation. We further employed the yeast two-hybrid system and identified kelch 
      repeat and BTB (POZ) domain containing 7 (KBTBD7), a substrate adaptor for the 
      CUL3-RING ubiquitin (Ub) ligase complex, as a DRD2-interacting protein. KBTBD6/7 
      directly interacted with, and ubiquitinated DRD2 at five ubiquitination sites (K221, 
      K226, K241, K251, and K258). CAB, a high-affinity DRD2 agonist, induced DRD2 
      internalization, and cytoplasmic DRD2 was degraded via ubiquitination under the 
      control of KBTBD6/7, the activity of which attenuated CAB-mediated inhibition of the 
      AKT/mTOR pathway. KBTBD7 knockout (KO) mice were generated using the CRISPR-Cas9 
      technique, in which the static level of DRD2 protein was elevated in the pituitary 
      gland, thalamus, and heart, compared to that of WT mice. Consistently, the 
      expression of KBTBD6/7 was negatively correlated with that of DRD2 in human 
      pituitary tumors. Moreover, KBTBD7 was highly expressed in dopamine-resistant 
      prolactinomas, but at low levels in dopamine-sensitive prolactinomas. Knockdown of 
      KBTBD6/7 sensitized MMQ cells and primary pituitary tumor cells to CAB treatment. 
      Conversely, KBTBD7 overexpression increased CAB resistance of estrogen-induced in 
      situ rat prolactinoma model. Together, our findings have uncovered the novel 
      mechanism of DRD2 protein degradation and shown that the KBTBD6/7-DRD2 axis 
      regulates PA sensitivity to DA treatment. KBTBD6/7 may thus become a promising 
      therapeutic target for pituitary tumors.

TI  - In vivo CRISPR screening unveils histone demethylase UTX as an important epigenetic 
      regulator in lung tumorigenesis.

AB  - Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Inactivation of 
      tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) promotes lung cancer malignant progression. Here, we 
      take advantage of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats 
      (CRISPR)/Cas9-mediated somatic gene knockout in a Kras(G12D/+) mouse model to 
      identify bona fide TSGs. From individual knockout of 55 potential TSGs, we identify 
      five genes, including Utx, Ptip, Acp5, Acacb, and Clu, whose knockout significantly 
      promotes lung tumorigenesis. These candidate genes are frequently down-regulated in 
      human lung cancer specimens and significantly associated with survival in patients 
      with lung cancer. Through crossing the conditional Utx knockout allele to the 
      Kras(G12D/+) mouse model, we further find that Utx deletion dramatically promotes 
      lung cancer progression. The tumor-promotive effect of Utx knockout in vivo is 
      mainly mediated through an increase of the EZH2 level, which up-regulates the 
      H3K27me3 level. Moreover, the Utx-knockout lung tumors are preferentially sensitive 
      to EZH2 inhibitor treatment. Collectively, our study provides a systematic screening 
      of TSGs in vivo and identifies UTX as an important epigenetic regulator in lung 
      tumorigenesis.

TI  - piRNAs derived from ancient viral processed pseudogenes as transgenerational 
      sequence-specific immune memory in mammals.
PG  - 1691-703
LID - 10.1261/rna.052092.115 [doi]
AB  - Endogenous bornavirus-like nucleoprotein elements (EBLNs) are sequences within 
      vertebrate genomes derived from reverse transcription and integration of ancient 
      bornaviral nucleoprotein mRNA via the host retrotransposon machinery. While species 
      with EBLNs appear relatively resistant to bornaviral disease, the nature of this 
      association is unclear. We hypothesized that EBLNs could give rise to antiviral 
      interfering RNA in the form of PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), a class of small RNA 
      known to silence transposons but not exogenous viruses. We found that in both 
      rodents and primates, which acquired their EBLNs independently some 25-40 million 
      years ago, EBLNs are present within piRNA-generating regions of the genome far more 
      often than expected by chance alone (ℙ = 8 × 10(-3)-6 × 10(-8)). Three of the seven 
      human EBLNs fall within annotated piRNA clusters and two marmoset EBLNs give rise to 
      bona fide piRNAs. In both rats and mice, at least two of the five EBLNs give rise to 
      abundant piRNAs in the male gonad. While no EBLNs are syntenic between rodent and 
      primate, some of the piRNA clusters containing EBLNs are; thus we deduce that EBLNs 
      were integrated into existing piRNA clusters. All true piRNAs derived from EBLNs are 
      antisense relative to the proposed ancient bornaviral nucleoprotein mRNA. These 
      observations are consistent with a role for EBLN-derived piRNA-like RNAs in 
      interfering with ancient bornaviral infection. They raise the hypothesis that 
      retrotransposon-dependent virus-to-host gene flow could engender RNA-mediated, 
      sequence-specific antiviral immune memory in metazoans analogous to the CRISPR/Cas 
      system in prokaryotes.

      Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) Clone,

AB  - This study undertook genome mining and comparative genomics to gain genetic insights 
      into the dominance of the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) endemic 
      clone ST612-CC8-t1257-SCCmec_IVd(2B), obtained from the poultry food chain in South 
      Africa. Functional annotation of the genome revealed a vast array of similar central 
      metabolic, cellular and biochemical networks within the endemic clone crucial for 
      its survival in the microbial community. In-silico analysis of the clone revealed 
      the possession of uniform defense systems, restriction-modification system (type I 
      and IV), accessory gene regulator (type I), arginine catabolic mobile element (type 
      II), and type 1 clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat 
      (CRISPR)Cas array (N = 7 ± 1), which offer protection against exogenous attacks. The 
      estimated pathogenic potential predicted a higher probability (average P(score) ≈ 
      0.927) of the clone being pathogenic to its host. The clone carried a battery of 
      putative virulence determinants whose expression are critical for establishing 
      infection. However, there was a slight difference in their possession of adherence 
      factors (biofilm operon system) and toxins (hemolysins and enterotoxins). Further 
      analysis revealed a conserved environmental tolerance and persistence mechanisms 
      related to stress (oxidative and osmotic), heat shock, sporulation, bacteriocins, 
      and detoxification, which enable it to withstand lethal threats and contribute to 
      its success in diverse ecological niches. Phylogenomic analysis with close sister 
      lineages revealed that the clone was closely related to the MRSA isolate SHV713 from 
      Australia. The results of this bioinformatic analysis provide valuable insights into 
      the biology of this endemic clone.

AB  - Transmembrane signals initiated by a range of extracellular stimuli converge on 
      members of the Gq family of heterotrimeric G proteins, which relay these signals in 
      target cells. Gq family G proteins comprise Gq, G11, G14, and G16, which upon 
      activation mediate their cellular effects via inositol lipid-dependent and 
      -independent signaling to control fundamental processes in mammalian physiology. To 
      date, highly specific inhibition of Gq/11/14 signaling can be achieved only with 
      FR900359 (FR) and YM-254890 (YM), two naturally occurring cyclic depsipeptides. To 
      further development of FR or YM mimics for other Gα subunits, we here set out to 
      rationally design Gα16 proteins with artificial FR/YM sensitivity by introducing an 
      engineered depsipeptide-binding site. Thereby we permit control of G16 function 
      through ligands that are inactive on the WT protein. Using CRISPR/Cas9-generated 
      Gαq/Gα11-null cells and loss- and gain-of-function mutagenesis along with label-free 
      whole-cell biosensing, we determined the molecular coordinates for FR/YM inhibition 
      of Gq and transplanted these to FR/YM-insensitive G16. Intriguingly, despite having 
      close structural similarity, FR and YM yielded biologically distinct activities: it 
      was more difficult to perturb Gq inhibition by FR and easier to install FR 
      inhibition onto G16 than perturb or install inhibition with YM. A unique hydrophobic 
      network utilized by FR accounted for these unexpected discrepancies. Our results 
      suggest that non-Gq/11/14 proteins should be amenable to inhibition by FR 
      scaffold-based inhibitors, provided that these inhibitors mimic the interaction of 
      FR with Gα proteins harboring engineered FR-binding sites.

TI  - Comparative genome analysis reveals metabolic versatility and environmental

AB  - The genus Sulfobacillus is a cohort of mildly thermophilic or thermotolerant 
      acidophiles within the phylum Firmicutes and requires extremely acidic environments 
      and hypersalinity for optimal growth. However, our understanding of them is still 
      preliminary partly because few genome sequences are available. Here, the draft 
      genome of Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans strain ST was deciphered to obtain a 
      comprehensive insight into the genetic content and to understand the cellular 
      mechanisms necessary for its survival. Furthermore, the expressions of key genes 
      related with iron and sulfur oxidation were verified by semi-quantitative RT-PCR 
      analysis. The draft genome sequence of Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans strain ST, 
      which encodes 3225 predicted coding genes on a total length of 3,333,554 bp and a 
      48.35% G+C, revealed the high degree of heterogeneity with other Sulfobacillus 
      species. The presence of numerous transposases, genomic islands and complete 
      CRISPR/Cas defence systems testifies to its dynamic evolution consistent with the 
      genome heterogeneity. As expected, S. thermosulfidooxidans encodes a suit of 
      conserved enzymes required for the oxidation of inorganic sulfur compounds (ISCs). 
      The model of sulfur oxidation in S. thermosulfidooxidans was proposed, which showed 
      some different characteristics from the sulfur oxidation of Gram-negative A. 
      ferrooxidans. Sulfur oxygenase reductase and heterodisulfide reductase were 
      suggested to play important roles in the sulfur oxidation. Although the iron 
      oxidation ability was observed, some key proteins cannot be identified in S. 
      thermosulfidooxidans. Unexpectedly, a predicted sulfocyanin is proposed to transfer 
      electrons in the iron oxidation. Furthermore, its carbon metabolism is rather 
      flexible, can perform the transformation of pentose through the oxidative and 
      non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathways and has the ability to take up small 
      organic compounds. It encodes a multitude of heavy metal resistance systems to adapt 
      the heavy metal-containing environments.

AB  - Bacteria from the genus Pedobacter are a major component of microbial assemblages at 
      Hanford Site (a largely decommissioned nuclear production complex) in eastern 
      Washington state, USA, and have been shown to change significantly in abundance in 
      response to the subsurface intrusion of Columbia River water. Here we employed 
      single-cell genomics techniques to shed light on the physiological niche of these 
      micro-organisms. Analysis of four Pedobacter single amplified genomes (SAGs) from 
      Hanford Site sediments revealed a chemoheterotrophic lifestyle, with the potential 
      to exist under both aerobic and microaerophilic conditions via expression of both 
      aa3-type and cbb3-type cytochrome c oxidases. These SAGs encoded a wide range of 
      both intra- and extracellular carbohydrate-active enzymes, potentially enabling the 
      degradation of recalcitrant substrates such as xylan and chitin, and the utilization 
      of more labile sugars such as mannose and fucose. Coupled to these enzymes, a 
      diversity of transporters and sugar-binding molecules were involved in the uptake of 
      carbon from the extracellular local environment. The SAGs were enriched in 
      TonB-dependent receptors, which play a key role in uptake of substrates resulting 
      from degradation of recalcitrant carbon. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short 
      Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR)-Cas mechanisms for resisting viral infections were 
      identified in all SAGs. These data demonstrate the potential mechanisms utilized for 
      persistence by heterotrophic micro-organisms in a carbon-limited aquifer, and hint 
      at potential linkages between observed Pedobacter abundance shifts within the 300 
      Area (in the south-eastern corner of the site) subsurface and biogeochemical shifts 
      associated with Columbia River water intrusion.

TI  - Analysis of defence systems and a conjugative IncP-1 plasmid in the marine

LID - 10.1111/1758-2229.12424 [doi]
AB  - Marine prokaryotes have evolved a broad repertoire of defence systems to protect 
      their genomes from lateral gene transfer including innate or acquired immune systems 
      and infection-induced programmed cell suicide and dormancy. Here we report on the 
      analysis of multiple defence systems present in the genome of the strain 
      Cycloclasticus sp. 78-ME isolated from petroleum deposits of the tanker 'Amoco 
      Milford Haven'. Cycloclasticus are ubiquitous bacteria globally important in 
      polyaromatic hydrocarbons degradation in marine environments. Two 'defence islands' 
      were identified in 78-ME genome: the first harbouring CRISPR-Cas with 
      toxin-antitoxin system, while the second was composed by an array of genes for 
      toxin-antitoxin and restriction-modification proteins. Among all identified spacers 
      of CRISPR-Cas system only seven spacers match sequences of phages and plasmids. 
      Furthermore, a conjugative plasmid p7ME01, which belongs to a new IncP-1θ ancestral 
      archetype without any accessory mobile elements was found in 78-ME. Our results 
      provide the context to the co-occurrence of diverse defence mechanisms in the genome 
      of Cycloclasticus sp. 78-ME, which protect the genome of this highly specialized 
      PAH-degrader. This study contributes to the further understanding of complex 
      networks established in petroleum-based microbial communities.

AB  - Desulfovibrio gigas is a model organism of sulfate-reducing bacteria of which energy 
      metabolism and stress response have been extensively studied. The complete genomic 
      context of this organism was however, not yet available. The sequencing of the D. 
      gigas genome provides insights into the integrated network of energy conserving 
      complexes and structures present in this bacterium. Comparison with genomes of other 
      Desulfovibrio spp. reveals the presence of two different CRISPR/Cas systems in D. 
      gigas. Phylogenetic analysis using conserved protein sequences (encoded by rpoB and 
      gyrB) indicates two main groups of Desulfovibrio spp, being D. gigas more closely 
      related to D. vulgaris and D. desulfuricans strains. Gene duplications were found 
      such as those encoding fumarate reductase, formate dehydrogenase, and superoxide 
      dismutase. Complexes not yet described within Desulfovibrio genus were identified: 
      Mnh complex, a v-type ATP-synthase as well as genes encoding the MinCDE system that 
      could be responsible for the larger size of D. gigas when compared to other members 
      of the genus. A low number of hydrogenases and the absence of the codh/acs and pfl 
      genes, both present in D. vulgaris strains, indicate that intermediate cycling 
      mechanisms may contribute substantially less to the energy gain in D. gigas compared 
      to other Desulfovibrio spp. This might be compensated by the presence of other 
      unique genomic arrangements of complexes such as the Rnf and the Hdr/Flox, or by the 
      presence of NAD(P)H related complexes, like the Nuo, NfnAB or Mnh.

AB  - Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-associated (Cas) 
      systems have been successfully used as efficient tools for genome editing in a 
      variety of species. We used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to mutate the Gn1a 
      (Os01g0197700), DEP1 (Os09g0441900), GS3 (Os03g0407400), and IPA1 (Os08g0509600) 
      genes of rice cultivar Zhonghua 11, genes which have been reported to function as 
      regulators of grain number, panicle architecture, grain size and plant architecture, 
      respectively. Analysis of the phenotypes and frequencies of edited genes in the 
      first generation of transformed plants (T0) showed that the CRISPR/Cas9 system was 
      highly efficient in inducing targeted gene editing, with the desired genes being 
      edited in 42.5% (Gn1a), 67.5% (DEP1), 57.5% (GS3), and 27.5% (IPA1) of the 
      transformed plants. The T2 generation of the gn1a, dep1, and gs3 mutants featured 
      enhanced grain number, dense erect panicles, and larger grain size, respectively. 
      Furthermore, semi-dwarf, and grain with long awn, phenotypes were observed in dep1 
      and gs3 mutants, respectively. The ipa1 mutants showed two contrasting phenotypes, 
      having either fewer tillers or more tillers, depending on the changes induced in the 
      OsmiR156 target region. In addition, we found that mutants with deletions occurred 
      more frequently than previous reports had indicated and that off-targeting had taken 
      place in highly similar target sequences. These results proved that multiple 
      regulators of important traits can be modified in a single cultivar by CRISPR/Cas9, 
      and thus facilitate the dissection of complex gene regulatory networks in the same 
      genomic background and the stacking of important traits in cultivated varieties.

AB  - In this consensus paper resulting from a meeting that involved representatives from 
      more than 20 European partners, we recommend the foundation of an expert group 
      (European Steering Committee) to assess the potential benefits and draw-backs of 
      genome editing (off-targets, mosaicisms, etc.), and to design risk matrices and 
      scenarios for a responsible use of this promising technology. In addition, this 
      European steering committee will contribute in promoting an open debate on societal 
      aspects prior to a translation into national and international legislation.

TI  - A Novel Screening Approach for the Dissection of Cellular Regulatory Networks of 
      NF-κB Using Arrayed CRISPR gRNA Libraries.
PG  - 618-633

AB  - CRISPR/Cas9 is increasingly being used as a tool to prosecute functional genomic 
      screens. However, it is not yet possible to apply the approach at scale across a 
      full breadth of cell types and endpoints. In order to address this, we developed a 
      novel and robust workflow for array-based lentiviral CRISPR/Cas9 screening. We 
      utilized a β-lactamase reporter gene assay to investigate mediators of 
      TNF-α-mediated NF-κB signaling. The system was adapted for CRISPR/Cas9 through the 
      development of a cell line stably expressing Cas9 and application of a lentiviral 
      gRNA library comprising mixtures of four gRNAs per gene. We screened a 743-gene 
      kinome library whereupon hits were independently ranked by percent inhibition, Z' 
      score, strictly standardized mean difference, and T statistic. A consolidated and 
      optimized ranking was generated using Borda-based methods. Screening data quality 
      was above acceptable limits (Z' ≥ 0.5). In order to determine the contribution of 
      individual gRNAs and to better understand false positives and negatives, a subset of 
      gRNAs, against 152 genes, were profiled in singlicate format. We highlight the use 
      of known reference genes and high-throughput, next-generation amplicon and RNA 
      sequencing to assess screen data quality. Screening with singlicate gRNAs was more 
      successful than screening with mixtures at identifying genes with known regulatory 
      roles in TNF-α-mediated NF-κB signaling and was found to be superior to previous 
      RNAi-based methods. These results add to the available data on TNF-α-mediated NF-κB 
      signaling and establish a high-throughput functional genomic screening approach, 
      utilizing a vector-based arrayed gRNA library, applicable across a wide variety of 
      endpoints and cell types at a genome-wide scale.

TI  - Control of de novo root regeneration efficiency by developmental status of 
      Arabidopsis leaf explants.

AB  - De novo root regeneration (DNRR) has wide applications in agriculture such as those 
      related to cutting technology. Detached Arabidopsis thaliana leaf explants can 
      regenerate adventitious roots without added hormones. The regenerative ability is 
      highly dependent on the developmental status of the leaf. An immature leaf has a 
      higher regenerative ability, while a mature leaf is difficult to regenerate. Using 
      RNA-Seq analysis, we showed that the expression levels of many genes, including 
      those in the auxin network, changed during leaf maturation. Particularly, the 
      expression levels of many YUCCA (YUC) genes in the auxin biosynthesis pathway are 
      responsive to leaf maturation. Overexpression of YUC1 in the yuc-1D dominant mutant 
      rescued the rooting defects caused by leaf maturation. In addition, YUC4 expression 
      levels were also affected by circadian rhythms. The regenerative ability was reduced 
      in both immature and mature mutant leaf explants from the new wuschel-related 
      homeobox 11-3 (wox11-3) and wox12-3 mutant alleles created by the CRISPR/Cas9 
      method. Overall, the transcriptome and genetic data, together with the auxin 
      concentration analysis, indicate that the ability to upregulate auxin levels upon 
      detachment may be reduced during leaf maturation. Thus, multiple developmental and 
      environmental signals may converge to control auxin accumulation, which affects the 
      efficiency of the WOX11/12-mediated DNRR from leaf explants.

AB  - Loss of organelle homeostasis is a hallmark of aging. However, it remains elusive 
      how this occurs at gene expression level. Here, we report that human mesenchymal 
      stem cell (hMSC) aging is associated with dysfunction of double-membrane organelles 
      and downregulation of transcription factor ATF6. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated inactivation 
      of ATF6 in hMSCs, not in human embryonic stem cells and human adipocytes, results in 
      premature cellular aging, characteristic of loss of endomembrane homeostasis. 
      Transcriptomic analyses uncover cell type-specific constitutive and stress-induced 
      ATF6-regulated genes implicated in various layers of organelles' homeostasis 
      regulation. FOS was characterized as a constitutive ATF6 responsive gene, 
      downregulation of which contributes to hMSC aging. Our study unravels the first 
      ATF6-regulated gene expression network related to homeostatic regulation of membrane 
      organelles, and provides novel mechanistic insights into aging-associated attrition 
      of human stem cells.

AB  - Both transcriptional regulation and signaling pathways play crucial roles in 
      neuronal differentiation and plasticity. Caenorhabditis elegans possesses 19 
      GABAergic motor neurons (MNs) called D MNs, which are divided into two subgroups: DD 
      and VD. DD, but not VD, MNs reverse their cellular polarity in a developmental 
      process called respecification. UNC-30 and UNC-55 are two critical transcription 
      factors in D MNs. By using chromatin immunoprecipitation with CRISPR/Cas9 knockin of 
      GFP fusion, we uncovered the global targets of UNC-30 and UNC-55. UNC-30 and UNC-55 
      are largely converged to regulate over 1,300 noncoding and coding genes, and genes 
      in multiple biological processes, including cAMP metabolism, are co-regulated. 
      Increase in cAMP levels may serve as a timing signal for respecification, whereas 
      UNC-55 regulates genes such as pde-4 to keep the cAMP levels low in VD. Other genes 
      modulating DD respecification such as lin-14, irx-1, and oig-1 are also found to 
      affect cAMP levels.

AB  - Mutagenic screening is powerful for identifying key genes involved in developmental 
      processes. However, such screens are successful only in lower organisms. Here, we 
      develop a targeted genetic screening approach in mice through combining androgenetic 
      haploid embryonic stem cells (AG-haESCs) and clustered regularly interspaced 
      palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) technology. We 
      produced a mutant semi-cloned (SC) mice pool by oocyte injection of AG-haESCs 
      carrying constitutively expressed Cas9 and an single guide RNA (sgRNA) library 
      targeting 72 preselected genes in one step and screened for bone-development-related 
      genes through skeletal analysis at birth. This yielded 4 genes: Zic1 and Clec11a, 
      which are required for bone development, and Rln1 and Irx5, which had not been 
      previously considered. Whereas Rln1-/- mice exhibited small skeletal size only at 
      birth, Irx5-/- mice showed skeletal abnormalities both in postnatal and adult phases 
      due to decreased bone mass and increased bone marrow adipogenesis. Mechanistically, 
      iroquois homeobox 5 (IRX5) promotes osteoblastogenesis and inhibits adipogenesis by 
      suppressing peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ) activation. Thus, 
      AG-haESC-mediated functional mutagenic screening opens new avenues for genetic 
      interrogation of developmental processes in mice.

AB  - Acute myeloid leukemia is a disorder characterized by abnormal differentiation of 
      myeloid cells and a clonal proliferation derived from primitive hematopoietic stem 
      cells. Interventions that overcome myeloid differentiation have been shown to be a 
      promising therapeutic strategy for acute myeloid leukemia. In this study, we 
      demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase leads 
      to apoptosis and normal differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia cells, indicating 
      that dihydroorotate dehydrogenase is a potential differentiation regulator and a 
      therapeutic target in acute myeloid leukemia. By screening a library of natural 
      products, we identified a novel dihydroorotate dehydrogenase inhibitor, 
      isobavachalcone, derived from the traditional Chinese medicine Psoralea corylifolia 
      Using enzymatic analysis, thermal shift assay, pull down, nuclear magnetic 
      resonance, and isothermal titration calorimetry experiments, we demonstrate that 
      isobavachalcone inhibits human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase directly, and triggers 
      apoptosis and differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia cells. Oral administration 
      of isobavachalcone suppresses subcutaneous HL60 xenograft tumor growth without 
      obvious toxicity. Importantly, our results suggest that a combination of 
      isobavachalcone and adriamycin prolonged survival in an intravenous HL60 leukemia 
      model. In summary, this study demonstrates that isobavachalcone triggers apoptosis 
      and differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia cells via pharmacological inhibition 
      of human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, offering a potential therapeutic strategy for 
      acute myeloid leukemia.

AB  - In humans, ciliary dysfunction causes ciliopathies, which present as multiple organ 
      defects, including developmental and sensory abnormalities. Sdccag8 is a 
      centrosomal/basal body protein essential for proper cilia formation. Gene mutations 
      in SDCCAG8 have been found in patients with ciliopathies manifesting a broad 
      spectrum of symptoms, including hypogonadism. Among these mutations, several that 
      are predicted to truncate the SDCCAG8 carboxyl (C)-terminus are also associated with 
      such symptoms; however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In the 
      present study, we identified the Sdccag8 C-terminal region (Sdccag8-C) as a module 
      that interacts with the ciliopathy proteins, Ick/Cilk1 and Mak, which were shown to 
      be essential for the regulation of ciliary protein trafficking and cilia length in 
      mammals in our previous studies. We found that Sdccag8-C is essential for Sdccag8 
      localization to centrosomes and cilia formation in cultured cells. We then generated 
      a mouse mutant in which Sdccag8-C was truncated (Sdccag8(ΔC/ΔC) mice) using a 
      CRISPR-mediated stop codon knock-in strategy. In Sdccag8(ΔC/ΔC) mice, we observed 
      abnormalities in cilia formation and ciliopathy-like organ phenotypes, including 
      cleft palate, polydactyly, retinal degeneration, and cystic kidney, which partially 
      overlapped with those previously observed in Ick- and Mak-deficient mice. 
      Furthermore, Sdccag8(ΔC/ΔC) mice exhibited a defect in spermatogenesis, which was a 
      previously uncharacterized phenotype of Sdccag8 dysfunction. Together, these results 
      shed light on the molecular and pathological mechanisms underlying ciliopathies 
      observed in patients with SDCCAG8 mutations, and may advance our understanding of 
      protein-protein interaction networks involved in cilia development.

AB  - The real value of gas-fermenting clostridia, capable of using CO and CO(2), resides 
      in their potential of being developed into cell factories to produce various bulk 
      chemicals and fuels. This process requires rapid chromosomal integration of 
      heterologous chemical biosynthetic pathways, which is impeded by the absence of 
      genetic tools competent for efficient genome engineering in these anaerobes. Here, 
      we developed a phage serine integrase-mediated site-specific genome engineering 
      technique in Clostridium ljungdahlii, one of the major acetogenic gas-fermenting 
      microbes. Two heterologous phage attachment/integration (Att/Int) systems (from 
      Clostridium difficile and Streptomyces) were introduced into C. ljungdahlii and 
      proven to be highly active, achieving efficient chromosomal integration of a whole 
      donor vector via single-crossover recombination. Based on this, we further realized 
      markerless chromosomal integration of target DNA fragments through a "dual integrase 
      cassette exchange" (DICE) strategy with the assistance of the CRISPR-Cas9 editing 
      system. As a proof of concept, a butyric acid production pathway from Clostridium 
      acetobutylicum was integrated into the C. ljungdahlii genome without the 
      introduction of extra markers, enabling stable expression of the pathway genes. The 
      resulting engineered strain produced 1.01 g/L of butyric acid within 3 days by 
      fermenting synthesis gas (CO(2)/CO). More importantly, the engineered strain showed 
      good genetic stability and maintained butyric acid production ability after 
      continuous subculturing. The system developed in this study overcomes the 
      deficiencies of currently available genetic tools in the chromosomal integration of 
      large DNA fragments (rapid, markerless and stable) in C. ljungdahlii, and may be 
      extended to other Clostridium species.

      little is known about how Lin28a function is modulated at the post-translational 
      level and thereby responds to major signaling pathways. Here we show that Lin28a is 
      directly phosphorylated by ERK1/2 kinases at Ser-200. By editing lin28a gene with 
      the CRISPR/Cas9-based method, we generated P19 mouse embryonic carcinoma stem cells 
      expressing Lin28a-S200A (phospho-deficient) and Lin28a-S200D (phospho-mimetic) 
      mutants, respectively, to study the functional impact of Ser-200 phosphorylation. 
      Lin28a-S200D-expressing cells, but not Lin28a-S200A-expressing or control P19 
      embryonic carcinoma cells, displayed impaired inhibition of let-7 miRNA and resulted 
      in decreased cyclin D1, whereas Lin28a-S200A knock-in cells expressed less let-7 
      miRNA, proliferated faster, and exhibited differentiation defect upon retinoic acid 
      induction. Therefore our results support that ERK kinase-mediated Lin28a 
      phosphorylation may be an important mechanism for pluripotent cells to facilitate 
      the escape from the self-renewal cycle and start the differentiation process.

AB  - Lubricin is a synovial glycoprotein that contributes to joint lubrication. We 
      propose the hypothesis that lubricin is a key modulator of the 
      psychoneuroendocrine-osteoimmune interactome, with important clinical relevance for 
      osteoarthritic pathologies. We consider a variety of neuroendocrine-immune factors, 
      including inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that may contribute to the 
      modulation of lubricin in rheumatic complications. Based on our preliminary 
      immunocytochemistry and fractal analysis data, and in the context of translational 
      research of modern healthcare, we propose that molecular lubricin gene expression 
      modification by means of the novel CRISPR/Cas system be considered for 
      osteoarthritic therapies.

AB  - Gemmata massiliana is a new Planctomycetes bacterium isolated from a hospital water 
      network in France, using a new culture medium. It is an aerobic microorganism with 
      optimal growth at pH 8, at 30 °C and salinity ≤ 1.25 % NaCl. G. massiliana is 
      resistant to β-lactam antibiotics, due to lack of peptidoglycan in its cell wall.G. 
      massiliana shares a 97 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with the nearest species, 
      Gemmata obscuriglobus; and 99 % similarity with unnamed soil isolates. Its 
      9,249,437-bp genome consists in one chromosome and no detectable plasmid and has a 
      64.07 % G + C content, 32.94 % of genes encoding for hypothetical proteins. The 
      genome contains an incomplete 19.6-kb phage sequence, 26 CRISPRs, 3 CAS and 15 
      clusters of secondary metabolites. G. massiliana genome increases knowledge of a 
      poorly known world of bacteria.

TI  - Transcriptome analysis reveals determinant stages controlling human embryonic stem 
      cell commitment to neuronal cells.
PG  - 19590-19604
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M117.796383 [doi]
AB  - Proper neural commitment is essential for ensuring the appropriate development of 
      the human brain and for preventing neurodevelopmental diseases such as autism 
      spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, and intellectual disorders. However, the 
      molecular mechanisms underlying the neural commitment in humans remain elusive. 
      Here, we report the establishment of a neural differentiation system based on human 
      embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and on comprehensive RNA sequencing analysis of 
      transcriptome dynamics during early hESC differentiation. Using weighted gene 
      co-expression network analysis, we reveal that the hESC neurodevelopmental 
      trajectory has five stages: pluripotency (day 0); differentiation initiation (days 
      2, 4, and 6); neural commitment (days 8-10); neural progenitor cell proliferation 
      (days 12, 14, and 16); and neuronal differentiation (days 18, 20, and 22). These 
      stages were characterized by unique module genes, which may recapitulate the early 
      human cortical development. Moreover, a comparison of our RNA-sequencing data with 
      several other transcriptome profiling datasets from mice and humans indicated that 
      Module 3 associated with the day 8-10 stage is a critical window of fate switch from 
      the pluripotency to the neural lineage. Interestingly, at this stage, no key 
      extrinsic signals were activated. In contrast, using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene 
      knockouts, we also found that intrinsic hub transcription factors, including the 
      schizophrenia-associated SIX3 gene and septo-optic dysplasia-related HESX1 gene, are 
      required to program hESC neural determination. Our results improve the understanding 
      of the mechanism of neural commitment in the human brain and may help elucidate the 
      etiology of human mental disorders and advance therapies for managing these 
      conditions.

TI  - Manipulating the position of DNA expression cassettes using location tags fused to 
      dCas9 (Cas9-Lag) to improve metabolic pathway efficiency.
PG  - 229

LID - 229
AB  - BACKGROUND: Deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) led to significant improvement of 
      CRISPR/Cas9-based techniques because it can be fused with a variety of functional 
      groups to form diverse molecular devices, which can manipulate or modify target DNA 
      cassettes. One important metabolic engineering strategy is to localize the enzymes 
      in proximity of their substrates for improved catalytic efficiency. In this work, we 
      developed a novel molecular device to manipulate the cellular location of specific 
      DNA cassettes either on plasmids or on the chromosome, by fusing location tags to 
      dCas9 (Cas9-Lag), and applied the technique for synthetic biology applications. 
      Carotenoids like β-carotene serve as common intermediates for the synthesis of 
      derivative compounds, which are hydrophobic and usually accumulate in the membrane 
      compartment. RESULTS: Carotenoids like β-carotene serve as common intermediates for 
      the synthesis of derivative compounds, which are hydrophobic and usually accumulate 
      in the membrane components. To improve the functional expression of membrane-bound 
      enzymes and localize them in proximity to the substrates, Cas9-Lag was used to pull 
      plasmids or chromosomal DNA expressing carotenoid enzymes onto the cell membrane. 
      For this purpose, dCas9 was fused to the E. coli membrane docking tag GlpF, and gRNA 
      was designed to direct this fusion protein to the DNA expression cassettes. With 
      Cas9-Lag, the zeaxanthin and astaxanthin titer increased by 29.0% and 26.7% 
      respectively. Due to experimental limitations, the electron microscopy images of 
      cells expressing Cas9-Lag vaguely indicated that GlpF-Cas9 might have pulled the 
      target DNA cassettes in close proximity to membrane. Similarly, protein mass 
      spectrometry analysis of membrane proteins suggested an increased expression of 
      carotenoid-converting enzymes in the membrane components. CONCLUSION: This work 
      therefore provides a novel molecular device, Cas9-Lag, which was proved to increase 
      zeaxanthin and astaxanthin production and might be used to manipulate DNA cassette 
      location.

AB  - Cancer/testis antigen MAGEC2, a member of the type I melanoma-associated antigen 
      family, is expressed in a wide variety of cancer types but not in normal somatic 
      cells. MAGEC2 has long been recognized as a tumor-specific target, however, its 
      functions remain largely unknown. In this study, we established MAGEC2-knockout A375 
      melanoma cell lines using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Seven clonal cell lines were 
      generated by using four single guide RNAs targeting the coding region of the MAGEC2 
      gene, which produced indels that abolished MAGEC2 protein expression. To identify 
      the differentially expressed protein profiles associated with MAGEC2 loss, isobaric 
      tag for relative quantitation-based comparative proteomics experiments were carried 
      out on the MAGEC2-knockcout and control A375 cells. Mining of the proteomics data 
      identified a total 224 (61.6% upregulated and 38.4% downregulated) proteins to be 
      significantly altered in expression level in MAGEC2-knockcout cells. Ingenuity 
      Pathway Analysis indicated that the significantly altered proteins were involved in 
      critical neoplasia-related biological functions such as cell death, proliferation, 
      and movement. Gene ontology analysis identified "apoptosis signaling" as the 
      top-most upregulated pathway associated with MAGEC2 loss. We showed that knockout or 
      knockdown of the MAGEC2 gene sensitized melanoma cells to tumor necrosis 
      factor-α-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, actin-based motility by Rho and RhoA 
      signaling, known to promote cell migration, were also identified as the top 
      downregulated pathways in MAGEC2-knockout A375 cells. In short, our study provides a 
      suitable cell model for exploring the biological functions of MAGEC2 in malignant 
      cells, and sheds light on the molecular pathway by which MAGEC2 promotes tumor 
      development.

TI  - Identification of a G2-like transcription factor, OsPHL3, functions as a negative 
      regulator of flowering in rice by co-expression and reverse genetic analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Flowering time is a key trait for regional adaption and seed production 
      in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Forward and reverse genetic studies have characterized a 
      number of flowering-time genes. However, co-expression analysis has not been used to 
      identify the flowering-time genes. RESULTS: We predicted a G2-like family 
      transcription factor, OsPHL3, by co-expression networks analysis with photoperiodic 
      flowering pathway genes. OsPHL3 contains a MYB-CC domain, and was localized in the 
      nucleus with transcriptional activation potential. OsPHL3 was mainly expressed in 
      the leaves and exhibited a circadian rhythmic expression pattern. Rice lines 
      overexpressing OsPHL3 showed a delayed flowering time in the genetic background of 
      TP309 under both long-day (Beijing) and short-day (Hainan) conditions. By contrast, 
      the knockout rice lines of OsPHL3 by CRISPR/Cas9 technology promoted flowering time 
      regardless of genetic backgrounds (i.e. Nipponbare and TP309) or day length. Further 
      analysis indicated that OsPHL3 delayed flowering time by down-regulating the 
      expression of Hd3a and RFT1 through promoting Hd1 under long-day conditions (LDs), 
      or suppressing Ehd1/Hd1 under short-day conditions (SDs). CONCLUSIONS: Our results 
      suggested that co-expression analysis is a useful strategy for identifying novel 
      flowering-time genes in rice.
