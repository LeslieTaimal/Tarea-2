AB  - Dengue viruses have spread rapidly within countries and across regions in the past 
      few decades, resulting in an increased frequency of epidemics and severe dengue 
      disease, hyperendemicity of multiple dengue virus serotypes in many tropical 
      countries, and autochthonous transmission in Europe and the USA. Today, dengue is 
      regarded as the most prevalent and rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease of 
      human beings. Importantly, the past decade has also seen an upsurge in research on 
      dengue virology, pathogenesis, and immunology and in development of antivirals, 
      vaccines, and new vector-control strategies that can positively impact dengue 
      control and prevention.

AB  - Dengue is a highly endemic infectious disease of the tropical countries and is 
      rapidly becoming a global burden. It is caused by any of the 4 serotypes of dengue 
      virus and is transmitted within humans through female Aedes mosquitoes. Dengue 
      disease varies from mild fever to severe conditions of dengue hemorrhagic fever and 
      shock syndrome. Globalization, increased air travel, and unplanned urbanization have 
      led to increase in the rate of infection and helped dengue to expand its geographic 
      and demographic distribution. Dengue vaccine development has been a challenging task 
      due to the existence of four antigenically distinct dengue virus serotypes, each 
      capable of eliciting cross-reactive and disease-enhancing antibody response against 
      the remaining three serotypes. Recently, Sanofi Pasteur's chimeric live-attenuated 
      dengue vaccine candidate has been approved in Mexico, Brazil, and Philippines for 
      usage in adults between 9 and 45 years of age. The impact of its limited application 
      to the public health system needs to be evaluated. Simultaneously, the restricted 
      application of this vaccine candidate warrants continued efforts in developing a 
      dengue vaccine candidate which is additionally efficacious for infants and naïve 
      individuals. In this context, alternative strategies of developing a designed 
      vaccine candidate which does not allow production of enhancing antibodies should be 
      explored, as it may expand the umbrella of efficacy to include infants and naïve 
      individuals.

AB  - Dengue fever, a very old disease, has reemerged in the past 20 years with an 
      expanded geographic distribution of both the viruses and the mosquito vectors, 
      increased epidemic activity, the development of hyperendemicity (the cocirculation 
      of multiple serotypes), and the emergence of dengue hemorrhagic fever in new 
      geographic regions. In 1998 this mosquito-borne disease is the most important 
      tropical infectious disease after malaria, with an estimated 100 million cases of 
      dengue fever, 500,000 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever, and 25,000 deaths annually. 
      The reasons for this resurgence and emergence of dengue hemorrhagic fever in the 
      waning years of the 20th century are complex and not fully understood, but 
      demographic, societal, and public health infrastructure changes in the past 30 years 
      have contributed greatly. This paper reviews the changing epidemiology of dengue and 
      dengue hemorrhagic fever by geographic region, the natural history and transmission 
      cycles, clinical diagnosis of both dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever, 
      serologic and virologic laboratory diagnoses, pathogenesis, surveillance, 
      prevention, and control. A major challenge for public health officials in all 
      tropical areas of the world is to develop and implement sustainable prevention and 
      control programs that will reverse the trend of emergent dengue hemorrhagic fever.

AB  - Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease of expanding geographical range and 
      increasing incidence. The vast majority of dengue cases are children less than 15 
      years of age. Dengue causes a spectrum of illness from mild fever to severe disease 
      with plasma leakage and shock. Infants and children with secondary heterologous 
      dengue infections are most at risk for severe dengue disease. Laboratory diagnosis 
      of dengue can be established within five days of disease onset by direct detection 
      of viral components in serum. After day five, serologic diagnosis provides indirect 
      evidence of dengue. Currently, no effective antiviral agents are available to treat 
      dengue infection. Therefore, treatment remains supportive, with emphasis on close 
      hematological monitoring, recognition of warning signs of severe disease and 
      fluid-replacement therapy and/or blood transfusions when required. Development of a 
      dengue vaccine is considered a high public health priority. A safe and efficacious 
      dengue vaccine would also be important for travelers. This review highlights the 
      current understanding of dengue in children, including its clinical manifestations, 
      pathogenesis, diagnostic tests, management and prevention.

AB  - Dengue is an important cause of childhood and adult morbidity in Asian and Latin 
      American countries and its geographic footprint is growing. The clinical 
      manifestations of dengue are the expression of a constellation of host and viral 
      factors, some acquired, others intrinsic to the individual. The virulence of the 
      virus plus the flavivirus infection history, age, gender and genotype of the host 
      all appear to help shape the severity of infection. Similarly, the characteristics 
      of the innate and acquired host immune response subsequent to infection are also 
      likely determinants of outcome. This review summarises recent developments in the 
      understanding of dengue pathogenesis and their relevance to dengue vaccine 
      development.

AB  - Dengue fever is a painful, debilitating, arthropod-borne disease. In recent years, 
      dengue endemic regions have markedly expanded in the tropics, South-east Asia, and 
      the Americas. Epidemics have also been re- ported in subtropical regions of East 
      Asia and Europe. Factors including an increase in the frequency of international 
      travel and period of stay, increase in population density, and global warming, are 
      hypothesized to be associated with the rapid spread of dengue. Approximately 4 
      billion people are estimated to be infected with the virus each year'). However, 
      there are no effective therapeutics nor clinically approved vaccine for dengue in 
      the region. In 2014, a local dengue outbreak involving 162 cases occurred in 
      Japan2). With the increasing annual numbers of imported dengue cases, there is a 
      need to strengthen and improve the capacity for disease control and prevention.

AB  - Dengue viruses are endemic in most tropical and subtropical countries where they 
      produce disease ranging from a mild fever to a severe, potentially fatal vascular 
      permeability syndrome. We reviewed the status of development and testing in children 
      of three vaccines designed to protect against the four dengue viruses. The first 
      dengue virus vaccine, Dengvaxia, now licensed in 20 endemic countries, the EU and 
      the USA, provides protection against severe dengue in seropositive individuals but 
      increases the risk for naive recipients to develop severe dengue and to be 
      hospitalised. We discuss mechanisms and implications of shortcomings of the licensed 
      vaccine and describe the structure and attributes of two other dengue virus 
      vaccines. Based upon human dengue challenge studies, one of these vaccines promises 
      to deliver solid, long-lasting immunity after a single dose. Because dengue virus 
      infections are ubiquitous in residents and visitors to tropical countries, in the 
      absence of a protective vaccine paediatricians should recognise the early signs and 
      clinical presentation of severe dengue, understand its pathophysiology and 
      appropriate management.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV), an arbovirus transmitted by mosquitoes, has become a major 
      threat to American human life, reaching approximately 23 million cases from 1980 to 
      2017. Brazil is among the countries most affected by this terrible viral disease, 
      with 13.6 million cases. DENV has four different serotypes, DENV1-4, which show a 
      broad clinical spectrum. Dengue creates a staggering epidemiological and economic 
      burden for endemic countries. Without a specific therapy and with a commercial 
      vaccine that presents some problems relative to its full effectiveness, initiatives 
      to improve vector control strategies, early disease diagnostics and the development 
      of vaccines and antiviral drugs are priorities. In this study, we present the 
      probable origins of dengue in America and the trajectories of its spread. Overall, 
      dengue diagnostics are costly, making the monitoring of dengue epidemiology more 
      difficult and affecting physicians' therapeutic decisions regarding dengue patients, 
      especially in developing countries. This review also highlights some recent and 
      important findings regarding dengue in Brazil and the Americas. We also summarize 
      the existing DENV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnostic tests to provide an 
      improved reference since these tests are useful and accurate at discriminating DENV 
      from other flaviviruses that co-circulate in the Americas. Additionally, these DENV 
      PCR assays ensure virus serotyping, enabling epidemiologic monitoring.

AB  - Dengue is the most common viral mosquito- borne disease. It is a major public health 
      problem, especially in tropical and sub-tropical areas worldwide. According to the 
      World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 40% of the world's population (over 
      2.5 billion people) live in areas with high risk of contracting dengue infection. 
      Adults of childbearing age and pregnant women are travelling more frequently to 
      tropical areas. Therefore exposing themselves to specific arboviral infections such 
      as dengue, which may impact ongoing and future pregnancies. Clinical manifestations 
      of dengue are wide ranging from asymptomatic to needing intensive care in cases of 
      hemorrhagic dengue fever. The effects of dengue during and on pregnancy are unclear, 
      moreover there is a lack of a cohesive reference to inform women of reproductive age 
      who live in or travel to endemic areas and are at risk of contracting dengue. Here 
      we present review of literature specifically looking at etiology, pathogenesis, 
      clinical manifestations, management of dengue in pregnancy as well as its effect on 
      maternal health and fetal outcomes. There is clear evidence to suggest adverse 
      maternal outcomes in women with symptomatic dengue in low resource countries. A high 
      index of clinical suspicion and early referral to tertiary center will prevent 
      maternal -fetal serious adverse events in endemic areas. This review will help 
      Clinicians in advising as well as managing women who travel during pregnancy to 
      endemic areas as well as clinicians based in endemic areas who are managing women 
      with dengue in pregnancy.

AB  - Dengue is the arboviral disease that has massively spread in intertropical regions 
      these past few years. The rise in imported cases of dengue and the rapid spread of 
      the Aedes vector mosquitoes in continental France since 2004 explain the occurrence 
      of indigenous dengue cases among the nonimmune population and points to an epidemic 
      risk. Severe dengue cases are rare, but lethality is highest among children under 5 
      years of age. Like pediatricians in tropical regions, we must learn how dengue 
      presents in metropolitan France and how it can be managed, and pay special attention 
      to severe and potentially fatal forms. The epidemiological, pathophysiological, 
      clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic characteristics of dengue are presented 
      herein.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dengue is a vector-borne viral infection that endangers an estimated 
      2.5 billion people. Disease caused by dengue ranges from a relatively minor febrile 
      illness to a life-threatening condition characterized by extensive capillary leak. A 
      greater understanding of dengue has the potential to improve both the clinical 
      management of individual cases and the control of the disease. SOURCES OF DATA: We 
      searched the available literature using PubMed, Embase and Web of Science for 
      relevant articles and abstracts. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: Addressing our gaps in the 
      understanding of disease pathogenesis and improving our knowledge of dengue virus 
      biology are necessary in order to develop tools to effectively control, diagnose and 
      treat the disease. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: The pathogenesis of dengue is 
      multifactorial and depends on both host and virus factors. A more integrated 
      understanding of disease pathogenesis is necessary. AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING 
      RESEARCH: There are many questions related to disease pathogenesis, development of 
      diagnostics, drug and vaccine development and individual case management that need 
      addressing if the disease is to be successfully tackled.

AB  - Current review article focuses on dengue, which is one of the most fatal infectious 
      illnesses and is considered to be a worldwide threat. The paper covers essential 
      topics including an overview on neglected tropical diseases with specific emphasis 
      on Dengue fever, mosquito's cycle of life and mechanism of infection, adaptive 
      response, and different stages in dengue immunopathogenesis. The current work is 
      also dedicated to the thorough study of dengue outbreak across the globe with a 
      narrowed study to tropical and subtropical regions. Moreover, this review article 
      demonstrates the correlation between climate factors and dengue incidence. 
      Furthermore, we present an overview of the detection strategies of dengue including 
      the latest developments in commercial and non-commercial platforms. Several attempts 
      in developing an effective vaccine to protect individuals from dengue infection and 
      the stage of clinical trials are gathered in the present work as well. Future 
      directions including bio-control are also discussed in this review article. In an 
      overall view, effective management of Dengue is a multidisciplinary task that 
      requires international involvement from different backgrounds and expertise to 
      address this global concern. This review article briefly portrays some of these 
      connecting areas across the disciplines while many other perspectives remain 
      uncovered.

AB  - Since the first isolation of dengue virus (DENV) in 1943, four types have been 
      identified. Global phenomena such as urbanization and international travel are key 
      factors in facilitating the spread of dengue. Documenting the type-specific record 
      of DENV spread has important implications for understanding patterns in dengue 
      hyperendemicity and disease severity as well as vaccine design and deployment 
      strategies. Existing studies have examined the spread of DENV types at regional or 
      local scales, or described phylogeographic relationships within a single type. Here 
      we summarize the global distribution of confirmed instances of each DENV type from 
      1943 to 2013 in a series of global maps. These show the worldwide expansion of the 
      types, the expansion of disease hyperendemicity, and the establishment of an 
      increasingly important infectious disease of global public health significance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is a serious global burden. Unreported and unrecognised apparent 
      dengue virus infections make it difficult to estimate the true extent of dengue and 
      current estimates of the incidence and costs of dengue have substantial uncertainty. 
      Objective, systematic, comparable measures of dengue burden are needed to track 
      health progress, assess the application and financing of emerging preventive and 
      control strategies, and inform health policy. We estimated the global economic 
      burden of dengue by country and super-region (groups of epidemiologically similar 
      countries). METHODS: We used the latest dengue incidence estimates from the 
      Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 
      and several other data sources to assess the economic burden of symptomatic dengue 
      cases in the 141 countries and territories with active dengue transmission. From the 
      scientific literature and regressions, we estimated cases and costs by setting, 
      including the non-medical setting, for all countries and territories. FINDINGS: Our 
      global estimates suggest that in 2013 there were a total of 58·40 million 
      symptomatic dengue virus infections (95% uncertainty interval [95% UI] 24 
      million-122 million), including 13 586 fatal cases (95% UI 4200-34 700), and that 
      the total annual global cost of dengue illness was US$8·9 billion (95% UI 3·7 
      billion-19·7 billion). The global distribution of dengue cases is 18% admitted to 
      hospital, 48% ambulatory, and 34% non-medical. INTERPRETATION: The global cost of 
      dengue is substantial and, if control strategies could reduce dengue appreciably, 
      billions of dollars could be saved globally. In estimating dengue costs by country 
      and setting, this study contributes to the needs of policy makers, donors, 
      developers, and researchers for economic assessments of dengue interventions, 
      particularly with the licensure of the first dengue vaccine and promising 
      developments in other technologies. FUNDING: Sanofi Pasteur.

PG  - 373-90
AB  - Dengue virus belongs to family Flaviviridae, having four serotypes that spread by 
      the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes. It causes a wide spectrum of illness from 
      mild asymptomatic illness to severe fatal dengue haemorrhagic fever/dengue shock 
      syndrome (DHF/DSS). Approximately 2.5 billion people live in dengue-risk regions 
      with about 100 million new cases each year worldwide. The cumulative dengue diseases 
      burden has attained an unprecedented proportion in recent times with sharp increase 
      in the size of human population at risk. Dengue disease presents highly complex 
      pathophysiological, economic and ecologic problems. In India, the first epidemic of 
      clinical dengue-like illness was recorded in Madras (now Chennai) in 1780 and the 
      first virologically proved epidemic of dengue fever (DF) occurred in Calcutta (now 
      Kolkata) and Eastern Coast of India in 1963-1964. During the last 50 years a large 
      number of physicians have treated and described dengue disease in India, but the 
      scientific studies addressing various problems of dengue disease have been carried 
      out at limited number of centres. Achievements of Indian scientists are 
      considerable; however, a lot remain to be achieved for creating an impact. This 
      paper briefly reviews the extent of work done by various groups of scientists in 
      this country.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Because efforts to control dengue are flagging, this review 
      focuses on the mechanisms underlying severe disease and on treatment options, good 
      and bad. RECENT FINDINGS: The year 2001 witnessed unprecedented global dengue 
      epidemic activity in the American hemisphere, the Pacific islands and continental 
      Asia. Early diagnosis of dengue is important but what is the value and appropriate 
      use of the tourniquet test? A negative test does not rule out dengue infection, a 
      positive test should be followed by close surveillance for early signs of dengue 
      hemorrhagic fever. Low platelet counts do not predict clinically significant 
      bleeding in dengue. It follows that platelet or blood transfusions should not be 
      administered based upon platelet count alone. Dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue 
      shock syndrome cases frequently have compensated consumptive coagulopathy that 
      seldom requires treatment. Bleeding is most likely caused by activated platelets 
      resulting from damaged capillary endothelium. Dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue 
      shock syndrome can be safely treated with just normal saline. Colloids should be 
      immediately given to children presenting with a pulse pressure at or below 10 mmHg. 
      Human leukocyte antigen alleles correlate with both protection and susceptibility to 
      dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome; studies in Haiti suggest that 
      blacks have a gene providing nearly complete protection against severe dengue 
      illness. SUMMARY: The role that antibodies play in protecting and enhancing dengue 
      infections has been largely ignored. Such studies require definitive knowledge of 
      what cells are infected in human dengue and an understanding of all the early 
      antibody-accessible steps of infection of these target cells.

TI  - Dengue in the elderly: a review.
PG  - 729-735
LID - 10.1080/14787210.2017.1358610 [doi]
AB  - Changing dengue epidemiological trends have resulted in a shift in the disease 
      burden to the adult population. Older adults suffer from poorer outcomes as compared 
      to their younger counterparts, making clinical management of this sub-population 
      particularly challenging. Areas covered: We present a review of the current 
      literature on the changing epidemiology of dengue in the elderly, the atypical 
      features of the clinical disease in this population with emphasis on severe disease 
      presentations and challenges in the current management strategies. Expert 
      commentary: Dengue in the elderly is an increasingly important yet greatly 
      understudied area. There is an urgent need to refine the current diagnostic criteria 
      to improve diagnosis, classification of disease severity and identify individuals in 
      this population who are likely to progress to severe disease. Management strategies 
      in this population would have to be adjusted to account for the increased number of 
      co-morbidities. The role of the available dengue vaccines in this group is 
      uncertain, and more studies into their safety and efficacy are critically needed.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to summarize research articles that 
      provide risk estimates for the historical and future impact that climate change has 
      had upon dengue published from 2007 through 2019. RECENT FINDINGS: Findings from 30 
      studies on historical health estimates, with the majority of the studies conducted 
      in Asia, emphasized the importance of temperature, precipitation, and relative 
      humidity, as well as lag effects, when trying to understand how climate change can 
      impact the risk of contracting dengue. Furthermore, 35 studies presented findings on 
      future health risk based upon climate projection scenarios, with a third of them 
      showcasing global level estimates and findings across the articles emphasizing the 
      need to understand risk at a localized level as the impacts from climate change will 
      be experienced inequitably across different geographies in the future. Dengue is one 
      of the most rapidly spreading viral diseases in the world, with ~390 million people 
      infected worldwide annually. Several factors have contributed towards its 
      proliferation, including climate change. Multiple studies have previously been 
      conducted examining the relationship between dengue and climate change, both from a 
      historical and a future risk perspective. We searched the U.S. National Institute of 
      Environmental Health (NIEHS) Climate Change and Health Portal for literature 
      (spanning January 2007 to September 2019) providing historical and future health 
      risk estimates of contracting dengue infection in relation to climate variables 
      worldwide. With an overview of the evidence of the historical and future health risk 
      posed by dengue from climate change across different regions of the world, this 
      review article enables the research and policy community to understand where the 
      knowledge gaps are and what areas need to be addressed in order to implement 
      localized adaptation measures to mitigate the health risks posed by future dengue 
      infection.

AB  - Dengue is the most important arthropod-borne viral disease of public health 
      significance. Its geographic distribution includes more than 100 countries 
      worldwide, where more than 2.5 billion people are at risk for dengue infections. 
      Most people will have asymptomatic infections, but the disease manifestations range 
      from an influenza-like disease known as dengue fever to a severe, sometimes fatal 
      disease characterized by hemorrhage and shock, known as dengue hemorrhagic 
      fever/dengue shock syndrome. Dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock 
      syndrome are caused by the dengue viruses (dengue-1, dengue-2, dengue-3, and 
      dengue-4) transmitted from viremic to susceptible humans mainly by the bites of 
      Aedes aegypti. There is no specific management of dengue infections, no vaccine is 
      commercially available, and vector control is the only alternative for stopping the 
      spread of the disease. Knowledge of several aspects of dengue infections, especially 
      of diagnosis and vaccine development, is continuously evolving, but several issues 
      are still unresolved.

AB  - Dengue, a major public health problem throughout subtropical and tropical regions, 
      is an acute infectious disease characterized by biphasic fever, headache, pain in 
      various parts of the body, prostration, rash, lymphadenopathy, and leukopenia. In 
      more severe or complicated dengue, patients present with a severe febrile illness 
      characterized by abnormalities of hemostasis and increased vascular permeability, 
      which in some instances results in a hypovolemic shock. Four distinct serotypes of 
      the dengue virus (dengue-1, dengue-2, dengue-3, and dengue-4) exist, with numerous 
      virus strains found worldwide. Molecular cloning methods have led to a greater 
      understanding of the structure of the RNA genome and definition of virus-specific 
      structural and nonstructural proteins. Progress towards producing safe, effective 
      dengue virus vaccines, a goal for over 45 years, has been made.

OAB - Dengue viral infection produces a spectrum of disease. For example, mild dengue 
      disease is characterized by biphasic fever, myalgia, arthralgia, leukopenia, and 
      lymphadenopathy, while dengue hemorrhagic fever is an often fatal disease 
      characterized by hemorrhages and shock syndrome. The disease, especially in its 
      severe form, is seen more often among children than among adults. With focus upon 
      India, dengue's etiology, epidemiology, pathology, pathogenesis of dengue 
      hemorrhagic fever, clinical manifestations of both the mild and severe forms of 
      dengue viral infection, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, treatment, prevention, 
      and prognosis are discussed.

TI  - Liver involvement in dengue viral infections.
LID - 10.1002/rmv.1971 [doi]
AB  - Dengue fever is the commonest viral haemorrhagic fever worldwide and is a leading 
      cause of morbidity and mortality in the tropics. Dengue viral infections are 
      frequently associated with varying degrees of liver injury. Liver injury is more 
      severe in dengue haemorrhagic fever or severe dengue. We review the current 
      knowledge on liver involvement following dengue viral infections and explore the 
      links between clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, and their impact on management.

AB  - The burden of dengue is large and growing. More than half of the global population 
      lives in areas with risk of dengue transmission. Uncertainty in burden estimates, 
      however, challenges policy makers' ability to set priorities, allocate resources, 
      and plan for interventions. In this report, the first in a Series on dengue, we 
      explore the estimations of disease and economic burdens of dengue, and the major 
      estimation challenges, limitations, and sources of uncertainty. We also reflect on 
      opportunities to remedy these deficiencies. Point estimates of apparent dengue 
      infections vary widely, although the confidence intervals of these estimates 
      overlap. Cost estimates include different items, are mostly based on a single year 
      of data, use different monetary references, are calculated from different 
      perspectives, and are difficult to compare. Comprehensive estimates that decompose 
      the cost by different stakeholders (as proposed in our framework), that consider the 
      cost of epidemic years, and that account for productivity and tourism losses, are 
      scarce. On the basis of these estimates, we propose the most comprehensive framework 
      for estimating the economic burden of dengue in any region, differentiated by four 
      very different domains of cost items and by three potential stakeholders who bear 
      the costs. This framework can inform future estimations of the economic burden of 
      dengue and generate demand for additional routine administrative data collection, or 
      for systematic incorporation of additional questions in nationally representative 
      surveys in dengue-endemic countries. Furthermore, scholars could use the framework 
      to guide scenario simulations that consider ranges of possible values for cost items 
      for which data are not yet available. Results would be valuable to policy makers and 
      would also raise awareness among communities, potentially improving dengue control 
      efforts.

AB  - Dengue virus is a single-stranded RNA virus that is a member of the family 
      Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus. It is usually transmitted by the female Aedes 
      aegypti mosquito. Dengue fever is a febrile illness caused by 1 of 4 serotypes of 
      the virus, which may progress to dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome. 
      The mortality rate of untreated dengue shock syndrome is more than 20%. The reported 
      incidence has increased 30-fold for the past 50 years with an estimated 50 to 100 
      million dengue infections globally each year, which includes 22,000 deaths. Because 
      of this rapid increase in numbers, more cases will be seen in forensic mortuaries, 
      with diagnostic problems arising from nonspecific or unusual manifestations. In this 
      review, the clinicopathological features of dengue viral infection are evaluated. 
      Adequate blood and tissue sampling at the time of autopsy is mandatory for 
      successful microbiological identification and characterization.

TI  - DENGUE VIRUS VIRULENCE AND DISEASES SEVERITY.
PG  - 35-42
AB  - The dengue virus is the causative agent of a wide spectrum of clinical 
      manifestations, ranging from mild acute febrile illness to classical dengue fever, 
      dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). DHF and DSS are the 
      potentially fatal forms of dengue virus infection, which has become an intractable 
      public health problem in many countries. The pathogeneses of DHF/ DSS are not 
      clearly understood. One hypothesis concerning virus virulence and the immune 
      enhancement hypothesis has been debated. Although dengue disease severity has been 
      associated with evidence of genetic differences in dengue strains, virus virulence 
      has been difficult to measure because of the lack of in vivo and in vitro models of 
      the disease.

AB  - Dengue is the most common arboviral disease affecting many countries worldwide. An 
      RNA virus from the flaviviridae family, dengue has four antigenically distinct 
      serotypes (DEN-1-DEN-4). Neurological involvement in dengue can be classified into 
      dengue encephalopathy immune-mediated syndromes, encephalitis, neuromuscular or 
      dengue muscle dysfunction and neuro-ophthalmic involvement. Acute disseminated 
      encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is an immune mediated acute demyelinating disorder of the 
      central nervous system following recent infection or vaccination. This monophasic 
      illness is characterised by multifocal white matter involvement. Many dengue studies 
      and case reports have linked ADEM with dengue virus infection but the association is 
      still not clear. Therefore, this article is to review and discuss concerning ADEM in 
      dengue as an immune-medicated neurological complication; and the management strategy 
      required based on recent literature.

TI  - International Dengue Vaccine Communication and Advocacy: Challenges and Way Forward.
PG  - 539-45
LID - 10.1586/14760584.2016.1152187 [doi]
AB  - Dengue vaccine introduction will likely occur soon. However, little has been 
      published on international dengue vaccine communication and advocacy. More effort at 
      the international level is required to review, unify and strategically disseminate 
      dengue vaccine knowledge to endemic countries' decision makers and potential donors. 
      Waiting to plan for the introduction of new vaccines until licensure may delay 
      access in developing countries. Concerted efforts to communicate and advocate for 
      vaccines prior to licensure are likely challenged by unknowns of the use of dengue 
      vaccines and the disease, including uncertainties of vaccine impact, vaccine access 
      and dengue's complex pathogenesis and epidemiology. Nevertheless, the international 
      community has the opportunity to apply previous best practices for vaccine 
      communication and advocacy. The following key strategies will strengthen 
      international dengue vaccine communication and advocacy: consolidating existing 
      coalitions under one strategic umbrella, urgently convening stakeholders to 
      formulate the roadmap for integrated dengue prevention and control, and improving 
      the dissemination of dengue scientific knowledge.

TI  - Dengue fever: a Wikipedia clinical review.
PG  - e105-15
AB  - Dengue fever, also known as breakbone fever, is a mosquito-borne infectious tropical 
      disease caused by the dengue virus. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle and 
      joint pains, and a characteristic skin rash that is similar to measles. In a small 
      proportion of cases, the disease develops into life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic 
      fever, which results in bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and leakage of blood plasma, or 
      into dengue shock syndrome, in which dangerously low blood pressure occurs. 
      Treatment of acute dengue fever is supportive, with either oral or intravenous 
      rehydration for mild or moderate disease and use of intravenous fluids and blood 
      transfusion for more severe cases. Along with attempts to eliminate the mosquito 
      vector, work is ongoing to develop a vaccine and medications targeted directly at 
      the virus.

PG  - 29-40
LID - 10.1586/14787210.2015.982094 [doi]
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is the arbovirus with the widest impact on human health. 
      Although its dispersal is partially conditioned by environmental constraints that 
      limit the distribution of its main vector (Aedes aegypti), DENV has been spreading 
      geographically in recent times, but mostly afflicting tropical and subtropical 
      regions. With no prophylactic vaccine or specific therapeutics available, vector 
      control remains the best alternative to restrain its circulation. Moreover, the 
      establishment of thriving vector populations in peri urban environments brings 
      humans and viruses together, opening the possibility for the occurrence of 
      unexpected outbreaks. Europe is no exception: such was the case of Madeira in 2012. 
      In addition to its impact on the health of the local population, health services, 
      and economy, this outbreak revealed how difficult it may be to control the 
      circulation of pathogenic arboviruses, especially taking into consideration that 
      Europe is already partially colonized by another DENV vector, Aedes albopictus.

TI  - Dengue viral infections in Pakistan and other Asian countries: a comprehensive 
      review.
PG  - 884-8
AB  - Infections due to Dengue virus are widespread throughout the world. Disease starts 
      with mild flu like sickness to a severe intricate condition which results in the 
      death of the patient. Dengue illness has high morbidity and mortality in Pakistan as 
      well as in other Asian countries. The Review article is a discourse analysis that 
      explores the facts about the history, emergence and impact of dengue in Pakistan and 
      other Asian countries. Data was collected from internet sources, mainly using 
      Science Direct and PubMed. The final literature was reviewed and summarised. About 
      150 articles were identified and 47 articles were shortlisted for final review. 
      Aedesaegypti was found to be a major vector for the transmission and spread of 
      dengue illness. Treatment comprises supportive therapy as no specific treatment was 
      available. During the last couple of years, the incidence of dengue fever was 
      extraordinary in metropolitan cities of Pakistan.

AB  - Dengue is an arbovirus affecting humans and spread by mosquitoes. Severe dengue 
      follows a secondary infection with a different virus serotype. The problem is truly 
      global as it is endemic in over 100 countries. Severe dengue can be a 
      life-threatening because of increased vascular permeability, resulting in leakage of 
      fluid from the intravascular compartment to the extravascular space. When major 
      bleeding does occur, it is almost invariably combined with profound shock since 
      this, in combination with thrombocytopenia, hypoxia, and acidosis, can lead to 
      multiple organ failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Dengue 
      hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome are among the leading causes of 
      morbidity and mortality in patients suffering from Dengue. Commercial rapid tests 
      and ELISA kits are freely available, ensuring early diagnosis. The basis of 
      management of severe dengue is effective fluid replacement. Future directions in 
      management will involve vector control and development of effective vaccination.

AB  - It has been estimated that more than 50 million cases of dengue occur worldwide each 
      year, mostly in the tropics. In light of recent cases appearing in central and 
      southern Florida, dengue has reemerged as a public health issue in the United States 
      with respect to infection control and prevention. We review the course of dengue 
      infection and its clinical presentation from the perspective of the practicing 
      otolaryngologist, and we outline tactics for prevention and management.

TI  - Recent Advances in Dengue: Relevance to Puerto Rico.
PG  - 65-70
AB  - Dengue represents an increasingly important public health challenge in Puerto Rico, 
      with recent epidemics in 2007, 2010, and 2012-2013. Although recent advances in 
      dengue vaccine development offer hope for primary prevention, the role of health 
      professionals in the diagnosis and management of dengue patients is paramount. Case 
      definitions for dengue, dengue with warning signs, and severe dengue provide a 
      framework to guide clinical decision-making. Furthermore, the differentiation 
      between dengue and other acute febrile illnesses, such as leptospirosis and 
      chikungunya, is necessary for the appropriate diagnosis and management of cases. An 
      understanding of dengue epidemiology and surveillance in Puerto Rico provides 
      context for clinicians in epidemic and non-epidemic periods. This review aims to 
      improve health professionals' ability to diagnose dengue, and as highlight the 
      relevance of recent advances in dengue prevention and management in Puerto Rico.

TI  - Fight against dengue in India: progresses and challenges.
PG  - 1367-78
LID - 10.1007/s00436-013-3342-2 [doi]
AB  - At the end of the last century, India has faced resurgence of many infectious 
      diseases, of which dengue is one of the most important in terms of morbidity and 
      mortality. The National Vector Borne Disease Control Program data show that dengue 
      is established in India and is becoming endemic to many areas (dengue cases have 
      increased steadily from ∼450 to ∼50,000 from 2000 to 2012). Despite extensive 
      efforts being made in developing the effective dengue control measures, the number 
      of dengue cases, their severity, and geographical boundaries are expanding 
      alarmingly and posing dengue as one of the deadly disease. Recently, the increasing 
      burden of dengue in the country has attracted the scientific as well as Indian 
      Government's administrative attention; however, a lot remain to be achieved for 
      managing the disease under threshold level. Like other vector-borne diseases, better 
      management of the dengue needs balanced approach involving various aspects like 
      disease prevention, cure/treatment, and the vector control, simultaneously. We have 
      briefly discussed here the situation of dengue in India and have tried to highlight 
      the worrying facets of dengue control and its implementation in Indian perspective. 
      The review on various aspects of dengue control has revealed an urgent need for 
      permanent surveillance programs, coupled with improvised disease diagnostics, 
      effective anti-dengue treatment measures, and controlling the disease transmission 
      by following an effective implementation of vector control programs.

TI  - WHO dengue case classification 2009 and its usefulness in practice: an expert 
      consensus in the Americas.
PG  - 19-25
LID - 10.1179/2047773215Y.0000000003 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In 2009, the new World Health Organization (WHO) dengue case 
      classification - dengue/severe dengue (D/SD) - was introduced, replacing the 1997 
      WHO dengue case classification: dengue fever/dengue haemorrhagic fever/dengue shock 
      syndrome (DF/DHF/DSS). METHODS: A 2-day expert consensus meeting in La Habana/Cuba 
      aimed to (1) share the experiences from Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) 
      member states when applying D/SD, (2) present national and local data using D/SD, 
      and (3) agree with the presented evidence on a list of recommendations for or 
      against the use of D/SD for PAHO, and also globally. RESULTS: Eight key questions 
      were discussed, concluding: (1) D/SD is useful describing disease progression 
      because it considers the dynamic nature of the disease, (2) D/SD helps defining 
      dengue cases correctly for clinical studies, because it defines more precisely 
      disease severity and allows evaluating dynamically the progression of cases, (3) 
      D/SD describes correctly all clinical forms of severe dengue. Further standards need 
      to be developed regionally, especially related to severe organ involvement, (4) D/SD 
      allows for pathophysiological research identifying - in a sequential manner - the 
      clinical manifestations of dengue related to pathophysiological events, (5) the 
      warning signs help identifying early cases at risk of shock (children and adults), 
      pathophysiology of the warning signs deserves further studies, (6) D/SD helps 
      treating individual dengue cases and also the reorganization of health-care services 
      for outbreak management, (7) D/SD helps diagnosing dengue, in presumptive diagnosis 
      and follow-up of the disease, because of its high sensitivity and high negative 
      predictive value (NPV), and (8) there is currently no update of the International 
      Disease Classification10 (ICD10) to include the new classification of dengue (D/SD); 
      therefore, there are not enough experiences of epidemiological reporting. Once D/SD 
      has been implemented in epidemiological surveillance, D/SD allows to (1) identify 
      severity of dengue cases in real time, for any decision-making on actions, (2) 
      measure and compare morbidity and mortality in countries, and also globally, and (3) 
      trigger contingency plans early, not only based on the number of reported cases but 
      also on the reported severity of cases. CONCLUSION: The expert panel recommends to 
      (1) update ICD10, (2) include D/SD in country epidemiological reports, and (3) 
      implement studies improving sensitivity/specificity of the dengue case definition.

TI  - Dengue: an update for clinicians working in non-endemic areas.
PG  - 82-5
LID - 10.7861/clinmedicine.15-1-82 [doi]
AB  - Dengue is one of the most rapidly emerging viral infections globally, with 2.5 
      billion people now thought to live in dengue-endemic areas. In addition, reports of 
      travel-related and autochthonous infections are increasing in non-endemic areas. 
      Most patients with dengue experience a self-limiting febrile illness, but a 
      proportion develop potentially life threatening complications around the time of 
      fever clearance, including plasma leakage occasionally leading to shock, bleeding, 
      and organ impairment. As dengue can present with non-specific symptoms of fever, 
      headache and myalgias, the potential for misdiagnosis and inappropriate management 
      by medical staff inexperienced with the disease is a concern. This short review will 
      outline the latest World Health Organisation disease classification, potential 
      complications, clinical assessment and management for clinicians working in 
      non-endemic areas.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An epidemic of type 4 dengue was raging in the Pacific from 2008 to 
      2010. During this period, several patients were hospitalized at the Hospital Centre 
      of Tahiti for neurological disorders occurring during a dengue fever. These events 
      are not the typical picture, which is represented by a flu-like syndrome and 
      sometimes, in severe cases, a haemorrhagic syndrome or shock. METHOD: We have 
      established a review of the literature reporting the cases of dengue fever 
      associated with neurological disorders with the terms "dengue" and "neurology". 
      Despite the retrospective nature and incomplete data, we attempted to establish the 
      epidemiological characteristics of these events, to give an order of frequency of 
      these symptoms and the pathophysiological mechanisms involved. RESULTS: Among 
      patients with neurological disorders occurring during a dengue fever, disorders of 
      central nervous system are the most common. Among disorders of central nervous 
      system, encephalopathy is by far the most encountered. CONCLUSION: None of observed 
      neurologic disorders presenting with specific manifestation, discussion of dengue as 
      etiology in endemic areas or in return from endemic area is well-founded.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Determining the disease and economic burden of dengue is critical for 
      the allocation of public health resources. Several studies have used 
      disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) to estimate the disease burden of dengue in 
      different regions. However, there are no published studies discussing the estimates 
      of dengue-related economic and disease burden specifically in Taiwan. OBJECTIVES: We 
      assessed the economic cost and disease burden of dengue infections in Taiwan for the 
      period 1998-2014, and compared these during epidemic and non-epidemic years. 
      METHODS: We estimated the annual DALYs per million population using the disability 
      weights for dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), dengue shock syndrome 
      (DSS), and death cases. Economic costs were estimated and divided into direct 
      (medical costs) and indirect costs (lost work days and caregiver fees). RESULTS: For 
      the period 1998-2014, a mean of 115.3 (range: 6.3-934.3) DALYs per million 
      population annually were lost to dengue. In epidemic years, direct costs associated 
      with dengue resulted mostly from hospitalization (86.09%), emergency (7.77%), 
      outpatient (6.10%), and drug costs (0.03%). For indirect costs, lost productivity 
      due to death (70.76%) was the dominant contributor. Overall, the costs were 12.3 
      times higher in epidemic years than in non-epidemic years (Wilcoxon rank sum test, 
      p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to evaluate the economic costs and 
      disease burden of dengue infections for this period in Taiwan, and reveals 
      significant differences in economic impact between epidemic and non-epidemic years.

TI  - DENGUE: GLOBAL THREAT.
PG  - 3-10
AB  - Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease, which is currently an expanding global 
      problem. Four closely related dengue serotypes cause the disease, which ranges from 
      asymptomatic infection to undifferentiated fever, dengue fever (DF), and dengue 
      hemorrhagic fever (DHF). DHF is characterized by fever, bleeding diathesis, and a 
      tendency to develop a potentially fatal shock syndrome. Dengue infection with organ 
      impairment mainly involves the central nervous system and the liver. Consistent 
      hematological findings include vasculopathy, coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia. 
      Laboratory diagnosis includes virus isolation, serology, and detection of dengue 
      ribonucleic acid. Successful treatment, which is mainly supportive, depends on early 
      recognition of the disease and careful monitoring for shock. A severity-based 
      revised dengue classification for medical interventions has been developed and 
      validated in many countries. There is no specific dengue treatment, and prevention 
      is currently limited to vector control measures. The world's first, large-scale 
      dengue vaccine efficacy study demonstrated its efficacy and a reduction of dengue 
      disease severity with a good safety profile in a study of more than 30,000 
      volunteers from Asia and Latin America.

PG  - 522-30

AB  - In tropical countries and possibly elsewhere, dengue fever can be confused with 
      other common tropical infections like enteric fever, leptospirosis, typhus fever, 
      malaria, etc. Many of these illnesses can present in significant numbers after 
      rains, and because of similar early presentations, can cause confusion in 
      decision-making. With global warming, these diseases can assume significant 
      proportions even in non-endemic areas. Identifying these illnesses in a non-immune 
      returning traveller is equally challenging. Recognition of these diseases is 
      important to diagnose them and treat them early, in order to avoid potentially fatal 
      complications. This review is an attempt to highlight important clinical and 
      laboratory differences among dengue fever-like illnesses.

TI  - [Dengue: a new approach].
PG  - 465-76
AB  - Previous definition of classic dengue, with or without bleeding, and of dengue 
      hemorrhagic fever (DHF) that may evolve without bleeding and with or without dengue 
      shock syndrome (DSS) are reviewed here. The classical approach to the diagnosis and 
      treatment of dengue, although useful in the past, nowadays breeds confusion and adds 
      a burden to the physician's task of decision-making regarding the treatment of 
      patients with severe forms of the disease. The classification of dengue proposed in 
      this paper, and summarized in a diagram, incorporates new concepts about sepsis, 
      systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and acute respiratory distress 
      syndrome (ARDS). This new approach, in our view, is a useful guide to initial 
      evaluation and treatment of the disease. It also approximates the dengue syndrome to 
      other protocols and medical procedures routinely used in intensive care units, 
      making it easier to be followed by the health personnel working in areas subject to 
      epidemic bursts.

TI  - Dengue infection: a growing global health threat.
PG  - 90-6
AB  - Dengue infection, one of the most devastating mosquito-borne viral diseases in 
      humans, is now a significant problem in several tropical countries. The disease, 
      caused by the four dengue virus serotypes, ranges from asymptomatic infection to 
      undifferentiated fever, dengue fever (DF), and severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) 
      with or without shock. DHF is characterized by fever, bleeding diathesis and a 
      tendency to develop a potentially fatal shock syndrome. Consistent hematological 
      findings include vasculopathy, coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia. There are 
      increasing reports of dengue infection with unusual manifestations that mainly 
      involve cerebral and hepatic symptoms. Laboratory diagnosis includes virus 
      isolation, serology, and detection of dengue ribonucleic acid. Successful treatment, 
      which is mainly supportive, depends on early recognition of the disease and careful 
      monitoring for shock. Prevention depends primarily on control of the mosquito 
      vector. Further study of the pathogenesis of DHF is required for the development of 
      a safe and effective dengue vaccine.

AB  - Due to the progressive spread of the dengue virus and a rising incidence of dengue 
      disease, its rapid diagnosis is important for developing countries and of increasing 
      relevance for countries in temperate climates. Recent advances in bioelectronics, 
      micro- and nanofabrication technologies have led to new miniaturized point-of-care 
      devices and analytical platforms suited for rapid detection of infections. Starting 
      from the available tests for dengue diagnosis, this review examines emerging rapid, 
      micro/nanotechnologies-based tools, including label-free biosensor methods, 
      microarray and microfluidic platforms, which hold significant potential, but still 
      need further development and evaluation. The epidemiological and clinical setting as 
      key determinants for selecting the best analytical strategy in patients presenting 
      with fever is then discussed. This review is aimed at the clinicians and 
      microbiologists to deepen understanding and enhance application of dengue 
      diagnostics, and also serves as knowledge base for researchers and test developers 
      to overcome the challenges posed by this disease. FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: Dengue 
      disease remains a significant problem in many developing countries. Unfortunately 
      rapid diagnosis with easy and low cost tests for this disease is currently still not 
      realized. In this comprehensive review, the authors highlighted recent advances in 
      nanotechnology which would enable development in this field, which would result in 
      beneficial outcomes to the population.

TI  - Dengue infection: a global concern.
PG  - S25-33
AB  - Dengue infection, one of the most important mosquito-borne viral diseases of humans, 
      is now a significant problem in several tropical countries. The disease, caused by 
      the four dengue virus serotypes, ranges from asymptomatic infection, 
      undifferentiated fever, dengue fever (DF) to severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) 
      with or without shock. DHF is characterized by fever, bleeding diathesis and a 
      tendency to develop a potentially fatal shock syndrome. Hematological findings 
      include vasculopathy, coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia as the most constant 
      findings. During the last twenty-five years, there have been increasing reports of 
      dengue infection with unusual manifestations, mainly with cerebral and hepatic 
      symptoms. Laboratory diagnosis includes virus isolation, serology and detection of 
      dengue ribonucleic acid. Successful treatment, which is mainly supportive, depends 
      on early recognition of the disease and careful monitoring for shock. Prevention 
      depends on control of the mosquito vector. More efforts must be made to understand 
      the pathogenesis of DHF in order to develop a safe and effective dengue vaccine.

PG  - S363-77
AB  - Dengue is an expanding health problem. About two-fifths of the world population are 
      at risk for acquiring dengue with 50-100 million cases of acute febrile illness 
      yearly including about 500,000 cases of DHF/DSS. No antiviral drugs active against 
      the flavivirus exist. Attempts to control mosquito vector has been largely 
      unsuccessful. Vaccination remains the most hopeful preventive measure. Dengue 
      vaccine has been in development for more than 30 years, yet none has been licensed. 
      The fact that enhancing antibody from previous infection and high level of T cell 
      activation during secondary infection contribute to immunopathology of DHF, the 
      vaccine must be able to induce protective response to four dengue serotypes 
      simultaneously. Inactivated vaccine is safe but needs a repeated booster thus, 
      development is delayed. Tetravalent live attenuated vaccine and chimeric vaccine 
      using yellow fever or dengue viruses as a backbone are being carried out in human 
      trials. DNA vaccine and subunit vaccine are being carried out in animal trials.

AB  - With several dengue vaccine candidates progressing through clinical trials, several 
      options for controlling this disease appear feasible. This would represent a major 
      achievement and reflect decades of research and development activities. The 
      challenges associated with the limited understanding of protective responses and 
      those factors which determine disease severity remain, but with prospective studies 
      ongoing in various dengue endemic areas and the initiation of dengue vaccine 
      efficacy trials, immune responses are being evaluated in the context of protection 
      and severe disease and these studies are highly likely to provide additional 
      insights.

LID - e2021070
AB  - Member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have faced 
      dengue outbreaks for decades, and the region has one of the highest rates of dengue 
      globally. Outbreaks continue to occur concurrently with the coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19) pandemic in the 10 ASEAN countries. Both infectious diseases pose a 
      tremendous burden in these countries related to both infection control and the 
      economy. Increases in the number of dengue cases occurred in part due to disruptions 
      in the pathogen-host-vector relationship caused by changes in human behaviour in 
      response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The spread of dengue was further aggravated by 
      the implementation of lockdowns and social distancing policies. These measures 
      limited the coverage of dengue preventive programs and delayed the medical 
      management of both diseases due to co-infection and misdiagnosis. It is of the 
      utmost importance for the population to remain aware of both diseases, and dengue 
      vector control strategies must be devised to properly address outbreaks using 
      digitalization and remote surveillance. Similarly, critical triage algorithms and 
      further research are also needed to combat co-infection and misdiagnosis. 
      Controlling the spread of COVID-19 though vaccination should also be undertaken to 
      reduce the impact of the pandemic.

TI  - Severe dengue: the need for new case definitions.
PG  - 297-302
AB  - Dengue fever imposes a societal burden that is difficult to measure because of the 
      disease's non-specific symptoms and the lack of easily applied case definitions for 
      its more severe manifestations. An efficacy trial of a tetravalent vaccine is 
      expected in the near future, but only one of the severe dengue syndromes-the 
      continuum of dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome-is well defined. 
      One of the results of the focus on dengue haemorrhagic fever is the false perception 
      of low disease burden in the Americas, which is an obstacle to the mobilisation of 
      political and economic resources to fight the disease. Three improvements are 
      necessary to standardise the dengue haemorrhagic fever definition and to allow it to 
      do well in different populations: (1) redefine the threshold for thrombocytopenia, 
      (2) clarify the standard practice and value of the tourniquet test, and (3) 
      incorporate a criterion to measure intravenous fluid replacement. In addition, for 
      an accurate estimation of dengue burden, locally appropriate definitions of severe 
      dengue must be devised and standardised so they will be considered valid in the 
      global research community.

AB  - There has been considerable debate regarding the value of both the 1997 and 2009 
      World Health Organization (WHO) dengue case classification criteria for its 
      diagnosis and management. Differentiation between classic dengue fever (DF) and 
      dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) or severe dengue is a key aspect of dengue case 
      classification. The geographic expansion of dengue and its increased incidence in 
      older age groups have contributed to the limited applicability of the 1997 case 
      definitions. Clinical experience of dengue suggests that the illness presents as a 
      spectrum of disease instead of distinct phases. However, despite the rigid grouping 
      of dengue into DF, DHF and dengue shock syndrome (DSS), overlap between the 
      different manifestations has often been observed, which has affected clinical 
      management and triage of patients. The findings of the DENCO study evaluating the 
      1997 case definitions formed the basis of the revised 2009 WHO case definitions, 
      which classified the illness into dengue with and without warning signs and severe 
      dengue. Although the revised scheme is more sensitive to the diagnosis of severe 
      dengue, and beneficial to triage and case management, there remain issues with its 
      applicability. It is considered by many to be too broad, requiring more specific 
      definition of warning signs. Quantitative research into the predictive value of 
      these warning signs on patient outcomes and the cost-effectiveness of the new 
      classification system is required to ascertain whether the new classification system 
      requires further modification, or whether elements of both classification systems 
      can be combined.

PG  - 22

LID - 22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bangkok plays a central role in the commerce of Thailand. This study 
      aimed to characterize the district-level spatial-temporal patterns of dengue in 
      Thailand and explore if a dengue peak in Bangkok led the peaks of dengue in other 
      Thai provinces. METHODS: Monthly dengue data at district level in Thailand from 
      January 2004 to December 2017 were obtained and used to assess the spatial and 
      seasonal patterns of dengue in Thailand. As our seasonal decomposition and 
      cross-correlation analyses showed that dengue in Bangkok peaked in November, which 
      was a few months after the dengue peak in most other provinces, we used a 
      time-series generalized linear model to explore if there was another province in 
      which the dengue case number was most predictive of dengue case numbers in other 
      Thai provinces. RESULTS: The highest district-level annual dengue incidence rates 
      (per 10,000) in the three time periods (i.e. 2004-2008, 2009-2013 and 2014-2017) 
      were 58.08 (Samphanthawong), 85.93 (Mueang Krabi), and 66.60 (Mae Sariang), 
      respectively. Dengue incidence rates in the western part of Northern Thailand, 
      southern part of Central Thailand, southern part of Eastern Thailand, and Southern 
      Thailand were higher than in other regions. Dengue in most districts of Thailand 
      peaked in June, July or August, but dengue peaks in all districts of Bangkok 
      occurred in November. The number of dengue cases in Nakhon Ratchasima was most 
      predictive of the number of dengue cases in other provinces in Thailand by a 
      one-month lag. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the dengue peak in Bangkok did 
      not lead the peaks of dengue in other Thai provinces. Future research exploring how 
      changes in socio-ecological factors (e.g. road network and climate factors) in 
      Nakhon Ratchasima have affected the transmission of dengue in Thailand might shed 
      some new light on the prevention and control of dengue.

AB  - Dengue infection is endemic in more than 100 countries, mostly in the developing 
      world. Recent observations indicate that the clinical profile of dengue is changing, 
      and that neurological manifestations are being reported more frequently. The exact 
      incidence of various neurological complications is uncertain. The pathogenesis of 
      neurological manifestations is multiple and includes: neurotrophic effect of the 
      dengue virus, related to the systemic effects of dengue infection, and immune 
      mediated. In countries endemic to dengue, it will be prudent to investigate for 
      dengue infection in patients with fever and acute neurological manifestations. There 
      is need for understanding of the pathogenesis of various neurological 
      manifestations.

AB  - A systematic literature review was conducted to describe the epidemiology of dengue 
      disease in Colombia. Searches of published literature in epidemiological studies of 
      dengue disease encompassing the terms "dengue", "epidemiology," and "Colombia" were 
      conducted. Studies in English or Spanish published between 1 January 2000 and 23 
      February 2012 were included. The searches identified 225 relevant citations, 30 of 
      which fulfilled the inclusion criteria defined in the review protocol. The 
      epidemiology of dengue disease in Colombia was characterized by a stable "baseline" 
      annual number of dengue fever cases, with major outbreaks in 2001-2003 and 2010. The 
      geographical spread of dengue disease cases showed a steady increase, with most of 
      the country affected by the 2010 outbreak. The majority of dengue disease recorded 
      during the review period was among those <15 years of age. Gaps identified in 
      epidemiological knowledge regarding dengue disease in Colombia may provide several 
      avenues for future research, namely studies of asymptomatic dengue virus infection, 
      primary versus secondary infections, and under-reporting of the disease. Improved 
      understanding of the factors that determine disease expression and enable 
      improvement in disease control and management is also important.

AB  - Dengue is a systemic infectious disease of viral etiology, transmitted by Aedes 
      mosquitoes. It causes between 50 and 100 million cases annually over 100 countries. 
      In most of the cases it presents as influenza-like illness or undifferentiated fever 
      and more than 500,000 patients develop dengue hemorrhagic fever. In America, dengue 
      fever is considered the most important resurgent disease and its hemorrhagic form is 
      becoming more relevant, especially given the steady increase in the number of 
      deaths. The first outbreaks of dengue in America were described in 1635. Since the 
      apparition of dengue hemorrhagic fever, in 1962, it has been considered a public 
      health problem because half of the population lives in endemic areas. The purpose of 
      this paper is to carry a briefly review of the epidemiology, clinical features, 
      pathophysiology, prevention and treatment of dengue fever, as well as create 
      recommendations in order to improve the quality of care and decrease mortality in 
      these patients.

AB  - Hundreds of thousands of dengue cases are reported worldwide each year. Given the 
      difficulty in obtaining full reporting, the actual number of human infections is 
      probably much higher than the number reported. Dengue is usually a nonspecific 
      febrile illness that resolves with supportive therapy but the clinical spectrum 
      ranges from asymptomatic infection through severe hemorrhage and sudden fatal shock. 
      The pathophysiology of the severe forms of dengue may be related to sequential 
      infection with different serotypes, variations in virus virulence, interaction of 
      the virus with environmental and host factors or a combination of these factors. 
      Control of dengue at the present time is dependent on control of the principal 
      vector mosquito, A. aegypti. Efforts to achieve such control are now focusing on 
      community education and action towards eliminating this mosquito's breeding sites 
      near human dwellings. Vaccine development continues, but at present the only way to 
      avoid dengue in an area where it is endemic or epidemic is to use repellents and 
      mosquito barriers. The movement of people to and from tropical areas makes dengue an 
      important differential diagnosis in any patient with an acute illness and history of 
      recent travel to tropical areas. Because of continued infestation of the 
      southeastern United States with A. aegypti, indigenous transmission in the 
      continental United States remains a public health concern.

AB  - BACKGROUNDS: Approximately, half of the population in the world including tropical 
      and sub-tropical climates region is at risk of dengue. Being an endemic country, 
      Bangladesh has experienced the largest dengue epidemic in 2019. The present study 
      aimed at evaluating the clinical and laboratory profile of dengue patients in 
      northern Bangladesh during the epidemic. METHODS: This cross-sectional study 
      included 319 serologically confirmed dengue patients admitted in Shaheed Ziaur 
      Rahman Medical College Hospital in Bogra district. It is one of the main tertiary 
      care hospitals in northern Bangladesh. Data were collected from July to September 
      2019. Patients' clinical and laboratory data were extracted from clinical records. 
      Patients were classified into two classes according to the WHO 2009 dengue 
      classification such as (i) non-severe dengue and (ii) severe dengue. Chi-square test 
      and independent t-test were used in this study. RESULTS: Of the 319 patients, 94.1% 
      had non-severe dengue and the remaining 5.9% had severe dengue (severe plasma 
      leakage 68.4%, severe organ involvement 68.4%, and severe clinical bleeding 10.5%). 
      Most of the patients were suffering from primary dengue infection. The most common 
      clinical presentation was fever followed by headache and myalgia. Vomiting and 
      abdominal pain were the most prevalent warning signs. The common hematological 
      findings on admission were leukopenia (63.3%), thrombocytopenia (30.4%) and 
      increased hematocrit (26.6%). Raised serum ALT or AST was observed in 14.1% cases 
      whereas raised serum creatinine was observed in 6.6% cases. Signs of plasma leakage 
      (pleural effusion, respiratory distress, and ascites, rise of hematocrit >20% during 
      hospital stay) and hepatic or renal involvement (serum ALT >42UI/L or serum 
      creatinine >1.2 mg/dL) on admission were mostly associated with severe dengue. 
      CONCLUSION: The study provides clinical evidence on presentation as well as 
      hematological and biochemical profile of dengue patients in northern Bangladesh that 
      should be implicated in effective patient management.

AB  - Every year, millions of individuals throughout the world are seriously affected by 
      dengue virus. The unavailability of a vaccine and of anti-viral drugs has made this 
      mosquito-borne disease a serious health concern. Not only does dengue cause 
      fatalities but it also has a profoundly negative economic impact. In recent decades, 
      extensive research has been performed on epidemiology, vector biology, life cycle, 
      pathogenesis, vaccine development and prevention. Although dengue research is still 
      not at a stage to suggest definite hopes of a cure, encouraging significant advances 
      have provided remarkable progress in the fight against infection. Recent 
      developments indicate that both anti-viral drug and vaccine research should be 
      pursued, in parallel with vector control programs.

AB  - Dengue is the disease transmitted by arthropods of major importance in public 
      health; however its presence in the neonatal stage is poorly studied, with few cases 
      described worldwide. We present the case report of a neonate who started illness at 
      12 days of age, characterized by fever and irritability. He was hospitalized for 
      suspicion of neonatal sepsis; later he presented thrombocytopenia and due the 
      antecedent of his mother with diagnosis of dengue after childbirth, dengue tests 
      were obtained in the neonate, resulting positive, then support treatment and fluid 
      treatment is performed, with subsequent recovery. Dengue in the neonatal stage 
      should always be suspected in areas where the disease is endemic and management 
      guides should be proposed.

AB  - Dengue causes more human morbidity globally than any other vector-borne viral 
      disease. Recent research has led to improved epidemiological methods that predict 
      disease burden and factors involved in transmission, a better understanding of 
      immune responses in infection, and enhanced animal models. In addition, a number of 
      control measures, including preventative vaccines, are in clinical trials. However, 
      significant gaps remain, including the need for better surveillance in large parts 
      of the world, methods to predict which individuals will develop severe disease, and 
      immunologic correlates of protection against dengue illness. During the next decade, 
      dengue will likely expand its geographic reach and become an increasing burden on 
      health resources in affected areas. Licensed vaccines and antiviral agents are 
      needed in order to effectively control dengue and limit disease.

AB  - The dengue virus (DENV) non-structural 1 (NS1) protein plays a critical role in 
      viral RNA replication and has a central position in DENV pathogenesis. DENV NS1 is a 
      glycoprotein expressed in infected mammalian cells as soluble monomers that dimerize 
      in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum; NS1 is subsequently transported to the 
      cell surface, where it remains membrane associated or is secreted into the 
      extracellular milieu as a hexameric complex. During the last three decades, the DENV 
      NS1 protein has also been intensively investigated as a potential target for 
      vaccines and antiviral drugs. In addition, NS1 is the major diagnostic marker for 
      dengue infection. This review highlights some important issues regarding the role of 
      NS1 in DENV pathogenesis and its biotechnological applications, both as a target for 
      the development of safe and effective vaccines and antiviral drugs and as a tool for 
      the generation of accurate diagnostic methods.

TI  - Dengue fever in international travelers.
PG  - 144-7
AB  - Dengue virus infection is becoming increasingly recognized as one of the world's 
      major emerging infectious diseases. Although only a few systematic studies have been 
      conducted to assess the incidence and clinical course of dengue fever in travelers, 
      it is now possible to estimate risk factors for travelers to areas of endemicity. 
      Dengue virus and its vector, Aedes mosquitoes, benefit from human habitation and 
      travel-related aspects of human behavior. Thus, travelers serve an important double 
      role as potential victims of the disease and as vehicles for further spread of 
      dengue.

TI  - A Rare Case of Dengue Encephalitis with Raised Procalcitonin.
PG  - e931519
LID - 10.12659/AJCR.931519 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND Dengue virus is a common arbovirus with uncertain neurotropism. Dengue 
      encephalitis is a rare but fatal manifestation of severe dengue. Diagnosis requires 
      high clinical suspicion. It should be routinely considered in patients with 
      encephalopathy, especially in countries where dengue virus is endemic. Unlike other 
      forms of severe dengue, the typical warning signs and biochemical derangements are 
      not reliable markers for dengue encephalitis. Alternative biochemical markers of 
      dengue encephalitis are needed. CASE REPORT We present a case of dengue encephalitis 
      with distinctly raised procalcitonin (13.2 μg/L), in the absence of the typical 
      warning signs and biochemical derangements of severe dengue. The patient was a 
      65-year-old man with fever and sudden loss of consciousness in the absence of other 
      localizing signs/symptoms. Inflammatory markers were raised, with findings of 
      leptomeningeal enhancement on brain computed tomography suggestive of 
      meningoencephalitis. Septic workup was unremarkable (normal renal and liver 
      functions, negative blood and urine cultures). The typical neurotropic 
      microorganisms were not detected in the cerebrospinal fluid. On day 4 of admission, 
      the patient reported abdominal pain and hematuria with a new onset of bicytopenia. 
      Subsequent investigations for dengue infection were positive for serum dengue NS1 
      antigen and dengue RNA (type 2 strain) in cerebrospinal fluid, confirming the 
      diagnosis of dengue encephalitis. The patient was managed supportively and 
      experienced full clinical recovery. CONCLUSIONS Dengue encephalitis is a rare 
      condition with nonspecific biochemical and imaging abnormalities. We demonstrated 
      that a raised procalcitonin level can occur in the setting of dengue encephalitis. 
      In endemic countries, this finding may prompt further investigations for dengue 
      encephalitis in patients with meningoencephalitis.

TI  - Approaches to refining estimates of global burden and economics of dengue.
PG  - e3306
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0003306 [doi]
LID - e3306
AB  - Dengue presents a formidable and growing global economic and disease burden, with 
      around half the world's population estimated to be at risk of infection. There is 
      wide variation and substantial uncertainty in current estimates of dengue disease 
      burden and, consequently, on economic burden estimates. Dengue disease varies across 
      time, geography and persons affected. Variations in the transmission of four 
      different viruses and interactions among vector density and host's immune status, 
      age, pre-existing medical conditions, all contribute to the disease's complexity. 
      This systematic review aims to identify and examine estimates of dengue disease 
      burden and costs, discuss major sources of uncertainty, and suggest next steps to 
      improve estimates. Economic analysis of dengue is mainly concerned with costs of 
      illness, particularly in estimating total episodes of symptomatic dengue. However, 
      national dengue disease reporting systems show a great diversity in design and 
      implementation, hindering accurate global estimates of dengue episodes and country 
      comparisons. A combination of immediate, short-, and long-term strategies could 
      substantially improve estimates of disease and, consequently, of economic burden of 
      dengue. Suggestions for immediate implementation include refining analysis of 
      currently available data to adjust reported episodes and expanding data collection 
      in empirical studies, such as documenting the number of ambulatory visits before and 
      after hospitalization and including breakdowns by age. Short-term recommendations 
      include merging multiple data sources, such as cohort and surveillance data to 
      evaluate the accuracy of reporting rates (by health sector, treatment, severity, 
      etc.), and using covariates to extrapolate dengue incidence to locations with no or 
      limited reporting. Long-term efforts aim at strengthening capacity to document 
      dengue transmission using serological methods to systematically analyze and relate 
      to epidemiologic data. As promising tools for diagnosis, vaccination, vector 
      control, and treatment are being developed, these recommended steps should improve 
      objective, systematic measures of dengue burden to strengthen health policy 
      decisions.

TI  - Dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever in the Americas: lessons and challenges.
PG  - 1-13
AB  - The incidence of dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DF/DHF) has increased 
      significantly over the last decades. Yearly, an estimated 50-100 million cases of DF 
      and about 250000-500000 cases of DHF occur worldwide. The epidemiological situation 
      in Latin America now resembles that in Southeast Asia. Here, the main clinical, 
      epidemiological and virological observations in the American region are presented 
      and compared with those previously reported from Southeast Asia. During 2002, more 
      than 30 Latin American countries reported over 1000000 DF cases. DHF occurred in 20 
      countries with more than 17000 DHF cases, including 225 fatalities. The 
      co-circulation of multiple serotypes has been reported from many countries. In the 
      Americas, DHF is observed both in children and adults; secondary infection by a 
      different dengue virus serotype has been confirmed as an important risk factor for 
      this severe form of the disease. However, some new risk factors such as the interval 
      of dengue virus infections and the ethnicity and underlying chronic conditions of 
      the patient have also been identified. The sequence of dengue virus infections and 
      association with certain genotypes are further factors of importance. We also 
      discuss the control and prevention strategies. In conclusion, without urgent action 
      for the prevention and control of dengue/DHF and its vector, the current situation 
      will worsen and, more dramatical, there is a risk of the urbanization of yellow 
      fever.

TI  - Primary Dengue Infection in Patients Requiring Hospitalization During an Outbreak in 
      a Low Incidence Mexican Region.
PG  - 380-386
LID - 10.1089/vbz.2019.2497 [doi]
AB  - Background: Dengue manifestations can range from subclinical to fatal. The study of 
      factors that influence dengue's clinical severity can provide information to 
      potentially limit or predict severe cases. Secondary infection (SI) with a different 
      dengue serotype has been recognized as an important determinant of severity. 
      However, severe dengue (SD) manifestations, including shock, can happen during 
      primary infection (PI) too and the mechanisms involved are less understood. To 
      characterize the severe manifestations associated to PI, we distinguished between 
      primary and secondary dengue cases in hospitalized patients from a region of low and 
      recent dengue incidence in central Mexico. This region can serve as a model for 
      dengue's behavior as it spreads to new areas worldwide. Methods: Dengue-specific 
      immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG concentrations were measured in the serum of 78 
      hospitalized patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever, and their ratios were used to 
      discriminate between PI and SI, as recommended by World Health Organization. 
      Clinical and laboratory manifestations were compared between PI and SI. Results and 
      Conclusions: PI was detected in 23% of hospitalized dengue cases, a proportion 
      similar to that reported in high-incidence regions in Mexico. PI was more frequent 
      in 16- to 40-year-olds, and was absent in patients older than 60 years. Only dengue 
      with warning signs and SD were present in the studied population of hospitalized 
      patients, and case frequency decreased with clinical severity both in PI and SI 
      groups. No significant differences in demographics, laboratory tests, or symptoms 
      were found between PI and SI, which illustrates that cases requiring hospitalization 
      during outbreaks can be severe, even if they are PI. This information can help plan 
      for sanitary contingencies in places where dengue is recently emergent and numerous 
      PI cases are expected. The mechanisms involved in PI clinical severity need to be 
      studied further.

TI  - How Important is Vertical Transmission of Dengue Viruses by Mosquitoes (Diptera: 
      Culicidae)?
PG  - 1-19
LID - 10.1093/jme/tjv168 [doi]
AB  - Vertical transmission of dengue viruses by mosquitoes was discovered at the end of 
      the late 1970s and has been suggested to be a means by which these viruses persist. 
      However, it is unclear how widespread it is in nature, and its importance in the 
      epidemiology of this disease is still debated. Here, we review the literature on 
      vertical transmission and discuss its role in dengue's epidemiology and control. We 
      conclude that given the number of studies that failed to find evidence of vertical 
      transmission, as well as mathematical models and its mechanistic basis, it is 
      unlikely that vertical transmission is important for the epidemiological persistence 
      of dengue viruses. A combination of asymptomatic infection in humans and movement of 
      people are likely to be more important determinants of dengue's persistence. We 
      argue, however, that there may be some need for further research into the prevalence 
      of dengue viruses in desiccated, as well as diapausing, eggs and the role of 
      horizontal transmission through larval cannibalism.

AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is the most common arthropod-borne viral disease of humans. 
      Although effective vaccines exist against other flaviviral diseases like yellow 
      fever and Japanese encephalitis, dengue vaccine development is complicated by the 
      presence of four virus serotypes and the possibility of partial immunity enhancing 
      dengue disease severity. Several live attenuated dengue vaccines are being tested in 
      human clinical trials. Initial results are mixed, with variable efficacy depending 
      on DENV serotype and previous DENV exposure. Here, we highlight recent discoveries 
      about the human antibody response to DENV and propose guidelines for advancing 
      development of safe and effective dengue vaccines.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2017, New Caledonia experienced an outbreak of severe dengue causing 
      high hospital burden (4379 cases, 416 hospital admissions, 15 deaths). We decided to 
      build a local operational model predictive of dengue severity, which was needed to 
      ease the healthcare circuit. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical and 
      biological parameters associated with severe dengue in the cohort of patients 
      hospitalized at the Territorial Hospital between January and July 2017 with 
      confirmed dengue, in order to elaborate a comprehensive patient's score. Patients 
      were compared in univariate and multivariate analyses. Predictive models for 
      severity were built using a descending step-wise method. RESULTS: Out of 383 
      included patients, 130 (34%) developed severe dengue and 13 (3.4%) died. Major risk 
      factors identified in univariate analysis were: age, comorbidities, presence of at 
      least one alert sign, platelets count < 30 × 10(9)/L, prothrombin time < 60%, AST 
      and/or ALT > 10 N, and previous dengue infection. Severity was not influenced by the 
      infecting dengue serotype nor by previous Zika infection. Two models to predict 
      dengue severity were built according to sex. Best models for females and males had 
      respectively a median Area Under the Curve = 0.80 and 0.88, a sensitivity = 84.5 and 
      84.5%, a specificity = 78.6 and 95.5%, a positive predictive value = 63.3 and 92.9%, 
      a negative predictive value = 92.8 and 91.3%. Models were secondarily validated on 
      130 patients hospitalized for dengue in 2018. CONCLUSION: We built robust and 
      efficient models to calculate a bedside score able to predict dengue severity in our 
      setting. We propose the spreadsheet for dengue severity score calculations to health 
      practitioners facing dengue outbreaks of enhanced severity in order to improve 
      patients' medical management and hospitalization flow.

TI  - Dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever in Latin America and the Caribbean.
PG  - 121-40, ix
AB  - Four serotypes of dengue viruses produce dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and 
      dengue shock syndrome. They are the most important arbovirus infections of humans, 
      in terms of both morbidity and mortality, constituting one of the most rapidly 
      expanding and re-emerging infectious disease problems in Latin America. In less than 
      20 years, the region has transformed itself from hypoendemic to hyperendemic, while 
      serotype circulation in most countries has gone from none or single to multiple. 
      Changes in endemicity have coincided with the emergence and increasing incidence of 
      the severer forms of dengue infection. This article reviews the clinical 
      presentations of these diseases. Health care providers who see patients in or 
      returning from areas of Latin America, the Caribbean, and other tropical areas must 
      consider dengue in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with compatible 
      symptoms, and must be knowledgeable in the current management of this important 
      disease.

PG  - 113-8
AB  - Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. It is endemic 
      in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean with periodic epidemics occurring at varying 
      intervals. There are three dengue serotypes present in Puerto Rico, at the present 
      time. The clinical manifestations of dengue in Puerto Rico are presented from a 
      historical perspective. Dengue in Puerto Rico has evolved from a clinically mild 
      illness in the 1960's to a devastating disease with hemorrhagic manifestations in 
      the 1980's and dengue shock syndrome in 1987. The approach to clinical diagnosis and 
      management is presented with emphasis on early recognition, performance of 
      tourniquet test, serial hematocrits and aggressive intravenous fluid replacement 
      with crystalloids of colloids in DSS. The best way to treat dengue is eliminating 
      the vector, therefore, prevention.

AB  - Traditionally, the four dengue virus serotypes have been associated with fever, 
      rash, and the more severe forms, haemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome. As our 
      knowledge as well as understanding of these viruses increases, we now recognise not 
      only that they are causing increasing numbers of human infections but also that they 
      may cause neurological and other clinical complications, with sequelae or fatal 
      consequences. In this review we attempt to highlight some of these features in the 
      context of dengue virus pathogenesis. We also examine some of the efforts currently 
      underway to control this "scourge" of the tropical and subtropical world.

AB  - Dengue disease is a mosquito-borne viral disease of expanding geographical range and 
      incidence. Infection by one of the four serotypes of dengue virus induces a spectrum 
      of disease manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic to life-threatening Dengue 
      hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome. Many efforts have been made to elucidate 
      several aspects of dengue virus-induced disease, but the pathogenesis of disease is 
      complex and remains unclear. Understanding the mechanisms involved in the early 
      stages of infection is crucial to determine and develop safe therapeutics to prevent 
      the severe outcomes of disease without interfering with control of infection. In 
      this review, we discuss the dual role of the innate and inflammatory pathways 
      activated during dengue disease in mediating both protection and exacerbation of 
      disease. We show that some mediators involved in each of these responses differ 
      substantially, suggesting that interfering in disease-associated immune pathways may 
      represent a potential therapeutic opportunity for the treatment of severe dengue.

TI  - Persistence of symptoms in dengue patients: a clinical cohort study.
PG  - 355-364
LID - 10.1093/trstmh/traa007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is commonly considered an acute illness and follows three phases: 
      febrile, critical in some cases and recovery. However, a number of studies have 
      described a continuation of dengue symptoms for weeks or months, extending the 
      recovery phase. Here we evaluate this persistence of dengue symptoms during 
      convalescence. METHODS: Our clinical cohort study included patients who sought 
      medical services 48 to 144 h from the onset of fever at seven hospitals or 
      ambulatory centers in Morelos, Mexico. Seventy-nine laboratory-confirmed dengue 
      patients were followed up regularly using clinic and/or home visits and telephone 
      calls for as long as symptoms persisted or up to 6 mo. RESULTS: In total, 55.7% of 
      patients had dengue-related symptoms 1 mo after the onset of fever; pain and 
      dermatological manifestations were the most common persistent symptoms. Prognostic 
      factors for symptom persistence were: ≥4 d of fever (RR 1.72; 95% CI 1.35 to 2.19), 
      platelet count ≤100 000/mm3 (RR 1.20; 95% CI 1.20 to 2.20), petechiae/bruises 
      (RR 1.97; 95% CI 1.56 to 2.48) and abdominal pain/hepatomegaly (RR 1.79; 95% CI 1.41 
      to 2.28). CONCLUSIONS: Persistence of dengue symptoms were common in 
      laboratory-confirmed dengue patients. Manifestations related to tissue damage were 
      associated with persistence after 30 d; host characteristics, such as age and health 
      status before infection, were associated with prolonged persistence (>60 d). The 
      burden of dengue may be higher than previously estimated.

AB  - This review describes and commentates on recent advances in the understanding of 
      dengue pathogenesis and immunity, plus clinical research on vaccines and 
      therapeutics. We expand specifically on the role of the dermis in dengue virus 
      infection, the contribution of cellular and humoral immune responses to pathogenesis 
      and immunity, NS1 and mechanisms of virus immune evasion. Additionally we review a 
      series of therapeutic intervention trials for dengue, as well as recent clinical 
      research aimed at improving clinical diagnosis, risk prediction and disease 
      classification.

PG  - 204-15
AB  - Dengue is one of the most important infectious diseases in tropical and subtropical 
      countries. At present, the only strategy available to reduce the incidence of dengue 
      is vector control. The World Health Organization and the Pan American Health 
      Organization have called on all nations to take the needed steps to help diminish 
      the burden of this disease and its medical and socioeconomic impact. It is hoped 
      that it will be possible to reverse the increase in dengue and help control its 
      spread through a coordinated, effective international response, along with 
      epidemiological, clinical, and virological research that brings together the most 
      advanced methods and techniques. This piece summarizes the most up-to-date 
      information on dengue, analyzes current epidemiologic trends in the Region of the 
      Americas, discusses the main global and Western Hemisphere initiatives to control 
      the disease, and presents the main areas of research that should be developed in the 
      immediate future.

TI  - Dengue Surveillance System in Brazil: A Qualitative Study in the Federal District.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17062062 [doi]
LID - 2062
AB  - Dengue's increasing trends raise concerns over global health and pose a challenge to 
      the Brazilian health system, highlighting the necessity of a strong surveillance 
      system to reduce morbidity, mortality, and the economic burden of this disease. 
      Although the Brazilian surveillance system reports more dengue cases than any other 
      country, recent studies suggest that non-reported cases are the majority. The aim of 
      the study is to explore the strengths and weaknesses of the Brazilian surveillance 
      system, particularly looking at the functioning of data collection and reporting. 
      This was done through qualitative semi-structured interviews with 17 experts in 
      dengue surveillance, supported by quantitative data from the official notification 
      system. To select the interviewees, purposive and theoretical sampling were used. 
      Data were analyzed through thematic analysis. The research highlighted that a lack 
      of human and technological resources in healthcare units and surveillance 
      departments slows down the notification process and data analysis. Due to a lack of 
      integration in the private sector, the surveillance system fails to detect the 
      socioeconomic profile of the patients. Investments in public healthcare, human and 
      technological resources for surveillance and better integration in the private 
      healthcare system, and vector surveillance may improve dengue surveillance.

TI  - Dengue infection in international travellers visiting Bali, Indonesia.
LID - 10.1093/jtm/tay061 [doi]
LID - tay061
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue, an acute febrile illness caused by infection with dengue virus 
      (DENV), is endemic in Bali, Indonesia. As one of the world's most popular tourist 
      destinations, Bali is regularly visited by domestic and international travellers, 
      who are prone to infection by endemic pathogens, including DENV. Currently, limited 
      data are available on the characteristics of dengue in travellers visiting Bali. 
      Information on the epidemiology and virological aspects of dengue in these tourists 
      is important to gain a better understanding of the dengue disease in international 
      travellers. METHODS: We performed a prospective cross-sectional dengue study 
      involving foreign travellers visiting Bali, Indonesia in the period of 2015-17. 
      Patients presenting at Kasih Ibu Hospital with fever and clinical symptoms of dengue 
      were asked to participate in the study. Clinical and laboratory assessments were 
      performed and sera were collected for molecular analysis, which included DENV 
      serotyping, genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: Among the 201 
      patients recruited, dengue was confirmed in 133 (66.2%) of them, based on detection 
      of NS1 antigen and/or viral RNA. Of these, 115 (86.5%) manifested dengue fever (DF) 
      and 18 (13.5%) dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF). The temporal predominance of 
      infecting DENV serotype was DENV-2 (48.7%), followed by DENV-3 (36.1%), DENV-1 
      (9.2%) and DENV-4 (3.4%). Phylogenetic analysis of DENV based on envelope gene 
      sequences revealed that the source of DENVs was local endemic viruses. CONCLUSION: 
      Our study confirms that dengue is one of the causes of fever in travellers visiting 
      Bali. Although it is a cause of significant morbidity, the majority of patients only 
      experienced mild DF, with only a small proportion developing DHF. We revealed that 
      DENVs isolated were autochthonous. Accurate diagnosis, preventive measures and 
      continuous disease surveillance will be useful for better management of dengue 
      infection in travellers.

TI  - Pathogenesis of dengue: challenges to molecular biology.
PG  - 476-81
AB  - Dengue viruses occur as four antigenically related but distinct serotypes 
      transmitted to humans by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. These viruses generally cause a 
      benign syndrome, dengue fever, in the American and African tropics, and a severe 
      syndrome, dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS), in Southeast 
      Asian children. This severe syndrome, which recently has also been identified in 
      children infected with the virus in Puerto Rico, is characterized by increased 
      vascular permeability and abnormal hemostasis. It occurs in infants less than 1 year 
      of age born to dengue-immune mothers and in children 1 year and older who are immune 
      to one serotype of dengue virus and are experiencing infection with a second 
      serotype. Dengue viruses replicate in cells of mononuclear phagocyte lineage, and 
      subneutralizing concentrations of dengue antibody enhance dengue virus infection in 
      these cells. This antibody-dependent enhancement of infection regulates dengue 
      disease in human beings, although disease severity may also be controlled 
      genetically, possibly by permitting and restricting the growth of virus in 
      monocytes. Monoclonal antibodies show heterogeneous distribution of antigenic 
      epitopes on dengue viruses. These epitopes serve to regulate disease: when 
      antibodies to shared antigens partially neutralize heterotypic virus, infection and 
      disease are dampened; enhancing antibodies alone result in heightened disease 
      response. Further knowledge of the structure of dengue genomes should permit rapid 
      advances in understanding the pathogenetic mechanisms of dengue.

TI  - Role of microparticles in dengue virus infection and its impact on medical 
      intervention strategies.
PG  - 3-18
AB  - Dengue virus (DV) is one of the most important vector-borne diseases in the world. 
      It causes a disease that manifests as a spectrum of clinical symptoms, including 
      dengue hemorrhagic fever. DV is proficient at diverting the immune system to 
      facilitate transmission through its vector host, Aedes spp. mosquito. Similar to 
      other vector-borne parasites, dengue may also require a second structural form, a 
      virus of alternative morphology (VAM), to complete its life cycle. DV can replicate 
      to high copy numbers in patient plasma, but no classical viral particles can be 
      detected by ultra-structural microscopy analysis. A VAM appearing as a microparticle 
      has been recapitulated with in vitro cell lines Meg01 and K562, close relatives to 
      the cells harboring dengue virus in vivo. VAMs are likely to contribute to the high 
      viremia levels observed in dengue patients. This review discusses the possible 
      existence of a VAM in the DV life cycle.

TI  - Critical care for dengue in adult patients: an overview of current knowledge and 
      future challenges.
PG  - 485-90
LID - 10.1097/MCC.0000000000000339 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review aims to update and summarize the current knowledge 
      about clinical features, management, and risk factors of adult dengue patients 
      requiring intensive care with consequently higher risk of mortality. RECENT 
      FINDINGS: Increasingly, there are more adult dengue patients who require intensive 
      care. This may be due to a shift in epidemiology of dengue infection from mainly a 
      pediatric disease toward adult disease. In addition, multiorgan dysfunction was 
      observed to be a key risk factor for ICU admission and mortality. This may be due to 
      older adults having preexisting comorbidities that potentially predispose to have 
      multiple severe organ impairment. Interventions remain largely supportive but also 
      require more evidence-based trials and treatment protocols. SUMMARY: These findings 
      highlight the common clinical manifestations of adult dengue patients and the 
      challenges of clinical management in ICU. Risk factors for prediction of adult 
      dengue patients who require ICU are available, but they lack validation and 
      consistent study design for meta-analysis in future. Early recognition of these risk 
      factors, with close monitoring and prompt clinical management, remains critical to 
      reduce mortality.

PG  - 11-12
AB  - COVID 19 since its onset in Wuhan in 2019 has overburdened our existing health 
      resources and infrastructure. Dengue virus has been endemic in Asian countries since 
      decades. Both being viruses with similar clinical profile and overlapping laboratory 
      parameters has posed a great challenge for Asian countries to combat a co epidemic, 
      creating a double burden. We, as clinicians must be more vigilant in diagnosing the 
      patients so that dengue is not missed in this covid pandemic era and does not 
      progress to life threatening dengue shock syndrome. More importantly, we should 
      emphasize on preventive measures for prevention of dengue so that we can reduce the 
      burden on health care system.

TI  - Dengue: a global threat.
PG  - S118-22
AB  - Dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease, is currently an expanding global problem. 
      The disease is caused by four closely related dengue serotypes; it ranges from 
      asymptomatic infection to undifferentiated fever, dengue fever (DF) and dengue 
      hemorrhagic fever (DHF). DHF is characterized by fever, bleeding diathesis and a 
      tendency to develop apotentially fatal shock syndrome. Dengue infection with organ 
      impairment mainly involves the central nervous system and liver. Consistent 
      hematological findings include vasculopathy, coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia. 
      Laboratory diagnoses include virus isolation, serology, and detection ofdengue 
      ribonucleic acid. Successful treatment, which is mainly supportive, depends on early 
      recognition of the disease and careful monitoring for shock. A severity-based 
      revised dengue classification for medical interventions has been developed and 
      validated in many countries. So far however, there has not been any specific dengue 
      treatment; prevention is currently limited to vector control measures. The world's 
      first, large-scale dengue vaccine, efficacy study demonstrated its efficacy and a 
      reduction of dengue's severity in a study of more than 10,000 volunteers in Asia. 
      Initial safety data are consistent with a good safety profile.

      of immune downregulation. It is a very rare condition in newborns. Dengue is a 
      potential virus causing HLH, but, in newborns, there are only few case reports and 
      limited clinical literature. OBSERVATION: Herein, in this report, we highlight a 
      case of neonatal HLH, triggered by perinatal dengue. The neonate manifested 
      clinically within the first week of life, the earliest reported timeline so far in 
      the literature. CONCLUSION: HLH should be excluded in neonates especially when 
      multisystem involvement cannot be explained by sepsis alone.

TI  - Research on dengue and dengue-like illness in East Asia and the Western Pacific 
      during the First Half of the 20th century.
PG  - 327-41
AB  - Dengue has become an enormous medical problem worldwide since the end of the World 
      War II (WWII). Despite a voluminous amount of research conducted worldwide for many 
      years to elucidate the mechanism of the development of the two severe forms of 
      dengue (dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS)), to develop 
      effective vaccines and to design reliable disease control and prevention strategies, 
      the goals of achieving these objectives are not in sight yet. For such a medical 
      research that requires a multi-directional approach to resolve a variety of research 
      questions, sometimes it is necessary to step back and re-examine historically how 
      the current status of the expanding global problems and sudden emergence of severe 
      forms of dengue have evolved in the first place. To examine the history of dengue 
      epidemiology, it is first necessary to put in perspective all relevant documents, 
      including a large number of nearly forgotten, old Japanese publications regarding 
      dengue outbreaks and allied background information in East Asia and the Western 
      Pacific that were documented before the emergence of the haemorrhagic disease 
      outbreaks in the 1950s there. The compiled data in this review, thus, fill in for 
      the first time many blanks in the early epidemiologic history of dengue in this part 
      of the world. Besides the data for epidemiologists, virologic data, clinical studies 
      of haemorrhagic manifestation, significance in military medicine and entomologic 
      investigations covered in this review should be useful for the current researchers 
      investigating any of those subjects.

TI  - Diagnosis of dengue in Sri Lanka: improvements to the existing state of the art in 
      the island.
PG  - 685-91
LID - 10.1093/trstmh/tru131 [doi]
AB  - Dengue fever (DF) is a mosquito borne virus infection which is endemic to the 
      tropical regions of the world. In Sri Lanka, the first sero-positive case was 
      reported in the 1960s; since then the island has experienced several outbreaks of 
      DF/dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF). The disease is more prevalent in some parts of 
      the country where rapid urbanisation has taken place. Diagnosis of DF/DHF is mainly 
      done using the clinical features only due to the unavailability of laboratory 
      diagnosis in many parts of the country and this might lead to over or under 
      diagnosis of the disease. A rational diagnostic approach which combines the history 
      and clinical profiles together with specific virological laboratory data would help 
      in the correct identification of the disease. Furthermore, a feasible algorithm for 
      the laboratory diagnosis of dengue will help to confirm the cases with a high level 
      of clinical suspicion. This would then facilitate the notification of correctly 
      identified cases to the public health authorities to assess the dengue burden. The 
      scope of this review is to improve the existing laboratory diagnosis of DF/DHF by 
      proposing a feasible algorithm to implement in Sri Lanka that would enable better 
      detection of cases.

TI  - Classifying dengue: a review of the difficulties in using the WHO case 
      classification for dengue haemorrhagic fever.
PG  - 1238-55
AB  - BACKGROUND: The current World Health Organisation (WHO) classification of dengue 
      includes two distinct entities: dengue fever (DF) and dengue haemorrhagic fever 
      (DHF)/dengue shock syndrome; it is largely based on pediatric cases in Southeast 
      Asia. Dengue has extended to different tropical areas and older age groups. 
      Variations from the original description of dengue manifestations are being 
      reported. OBJECTIVES: To analyse the experience of clinicians in using the dengue 
      case classification and identify challenges in applying the criteria in routine 
      clinical practice. METHOD: Systematic literature review of post-1975 
      English-language publications on dengue classification. RESULTS: Thirty-seven papers 
      were reviewed. Several studies had strictly applied all four WHO criteria in DHF 
      cases; however, most clinicians reported difficulties in meeting all four criteria 
      and used a modified classification. The positive tourniquet test representing the 
      minimum requirement of a haemorrhagic manifestation did not distinguish between DHF 
      and DF. In cases of DHF thrombocytopenia was observed in 8.6-96%, plasma leakage in 
      6-95% and haemorrhagic manifestations in 22-93%. The low sensitivity of classifying 
      DHF could be due to failure to repeat the tests or physical examinations at the 
      appropriate time, early intravenous fluid therapy, and lack of adequate resources in 
      an epidemic situation and perhaps a considerable overlap of clinical manifestations 
      in the different dengue entities. CONCLUSION: A prospective multi-centre study 
      across dengue endemic regions, age groups and the health care system is required 
      which describes the clinical presentation of dengue including simple laboratory 
      parameters in order to review and if necessary modify the current dengue 
      classification.

AB  - Informed decisions concerning emerging technologies against dengue require knowledge 
      about the disease's economic cost and each stakeholder's potential benefits from 
      better control. To generate such data for Indonesia, we reviewed recent literature, 
      analyzed expenditure and utilization data from two hospitals and two primary care 
      facilities in Yogyakarta city, and interviewed 67 dengue patients from hospital, 
      ambulatory, and not medically attended settings. We derived the cost of a dengue 
      episode by outcome, setting, and the breakdown by payer. We then calculated 
      aggregate Yogyakarta and national costs and 95% uncertainty intervals (95% UIs). 
      Dengue costs per nonfatal case in hospital, ambulatory, not medically attended, and 
      overall average settings were US$316.24 (95% UI: $242.30-$390.18), US$22.45 (95% UI: 
      $14.12-$30.77), US$7.48 (95% UI: $2.36-$12.60), and US$50.41 (95% UI: 
      $35.75-$65.07), respectively. Costs of nonfatal episodes were borne by the patient's 
      household (37%), social contributors (relatives and friends, 20%), national health 
      insurance (25%), and other sources (government, charity, and private insurance, 
      18%). After including fatal cases, the average cost per episode became $90.41 (95% 
      UI: $72.79-$112.35). Indonesia had an estimated 7.535 (95% UI: 1.319-16.513) million 
      dengue episodes in 2017, giving national aggregate costs of $681.26 (95% UI: 
      $232.28-$2,371.56) million. Unlike most previous research that examined only the 
      formal medical sector, this study included the estimated 63% of national dengue 
      episodes that were not medically attended. Also, this study used actual costs, 
      rather than charges, which generally understate dengue's economic burden in public 
      facilities. Overall, this study found that Indonesia's aggregate cost of dengue was 
      73% higher than previously estimated, strengthening the need for effective control.

TI  - Perinatal dengue infection: a case report and review of literature.
PG  - 793-6
AB  - A case of vertical transmission of dengue infection in the perinatal period is 
      reported. The mother, a term pregnancy, had acute dengue the day before admission. 
      The infant was born at term and developed fever on the fifth day of life which 
      lasted for 5 days. No bleeding or plasma leakage was detected during the course of 
      fever in infant or mother. A liver function test showed elevated SGOT and SGPT in 
      the infant. The infant developed a convalescent rash on day 5 of the fever. The 
      diagnosis of secondary dengue hemorrhagic fever in the mother was confirmed by 
      serology and primary dengue infection in the infant was confirmed by serology and 
      serotyped as dengue type 2 by PCR. The clinical course and management of mothers and 
      infants with perinatal dengue infection are reviewed.

TI  - Management of severe dengue in children.
PG  - 131-44
LID - 10.1007/978-0-387-73960-1_10 [doi]
AB  - Dengue is a major global disease which, in its severe form, affects up to 500,000 
      people worldwide each year, most of whom are children. The development of a safe and 
      effective vaccine is a clear priority, together with public health measures to 
      prevent the spread of infection. However, while major epidemics continue to occur, 
      clinicians must also focus on optimising management. Although no specific treatment 
      is available at present, with good supportive care, mortality for children with DHF 
      can be reduced to well below 1%. In patients without signs of shock, fluid 
      replacement can be attempted orally, but in children with DSS parenteral treatment 
      is essential. Very careful titration of fluid therapy is necessary combined with 
      frequent reassessment for signs of worsening shock or the development of fluid 
      overload. In most DSS cases isotonic crystalloid solutions are as effective as 
      colloid solutions, but the question whether early intervention with colloid 
      solutions improves outcome in more advanced shock requires further investigation. 
      The outcome of studies to address this question, together with further research to 
      examine the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the plasma leakage, will 
      hopefully result in better management of children with severe dengue but may also 
      provide useful insights into other diseases that affect endothelial function.

TI  - Dengue fever in renal allograft recipients: Clinical course and outcome.
PG  - e12875
LID - 10.1111/tid.12875 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are annual outbreaks of dengue infection in tropical and 
      subtropical countries. This retrospective study aimed to assess the clinical 
      manifestation of dengue and outcome in renal transplant recipients. METHODS: Renal 
      transplant recipients diagnosed with dengue in the nephrology department during the 
      outbreak from August 2015 to December 2015 were included in the study. RESULTS: 
      Twenty patients developed dengue presenting during the outbreak. Mean age was 
      31.9 ± 8.8 years and all were males. Two patients had severe dengue (dengue 
      hemorrhagic fever, dengue shock syndrome). Clinical presentation included febrile 
      illness (95%), myalgia (65%), headache (30%), retro-orbital pain (10%), and 
      mucocutaneous bleeding manifestations (10%). Three (15%) had third space fluid 
      accumulation and 2 (10%) had hypotension. Ninety percent patients had 
      thrombocytopenia, with 4 requiring platelet transfusion. Leucopenia 
      (WBC < 4000/mm(3) ) developed in 50% patients. About 60% had transient 
      transaminitis. One patient with severed dengue expired and 1 recovered with IV 
      immunoglobulin therapy. About 40% patients had rise in serum creatinine, with 
      complete recovery in all patients. CONCLUSION: Clinical manifestations of dengue 
      infection in renal transplant recipients were similar to that in general population. 
      However, leucopenia necessitating temporary withdrawal of immunosuppression was 
      common. Renal dysfunction was frequent but completely reversible.

AB  - The mounting evidence for anthropogenic changes in global climate raises many 
      pressing questions about the potential effects on biological systems, and in 
      particular the transmission of infectious diseases. Vector-borne diseases, such as 
      dengue, may be particularly sensitive to both periodic fluctuations and sustained 
      changes in global and local climates, because vector biology and viral replication 
      are temperature- and moisture-dependent. This paper reviews the current state of 
      knowledge on the associations between climate variability, climate change and dengue 
      transmission, and the tools being used to quantify these associations. The 
      underlying causes of dengue's recent global expansion are multifactorial and poorly 
      understood, but climatic factors should be considered within the context of the 
      sociodemographic, economic and immunological determinants that have contributed to 
      dengue's spread. These factors may mediate the direct effects of climate on dengue 
      and many may operate at a very local level. Translating theoretical models of dengue 
      transmission based on historical data into predictive models that can inform public 
      health interventions is a critical next step and efforts should be focused on 
      developing and refining models at smaller spatial scales to characterize the 
      relationships between both climatic and non-climatic factors and dengue risk.

AB  - Dengue's re-emerging epidemiology poses a major global health threat. India 
      contributes significantly to the global communicable disease burden has been 
      declared highly dengue-endemic, exposing public health authorities to severe 
      challenges. Our study aims to provide a deeper understanding of India's urban dengue 
      surveillance policies as well as to explore the organisation, functioning and 
      integration of existing disease control pillars. We conducted a qualitative regional 
      case study, consisting of semi-structured expert interviews and observational data, 
      covering the urban region of Hyderabad in South India. Our findings indicate that 
      Hyderabad's dengue surveillance system predominantly relies on public reporting 
      units, neglecting India's large private health sector. The surveillance system 
      requires further strengthening and additional efforts to efficiently integrate 
      existing governmental initiatives at all geographical levels and administrative 
      boundaries. We concluded with recommendations for improved consistency, accuracy, 
      efficiency and reduction of system fragmentation to enhance the integration of 
      dengue surveillance and improved health information in urban India. Finally, our 
      study underlines India's overall need to increase investment in public health and 
      health infrastructures. That requires coordinated and multi-level action targeting 
      the development of a competent, effective and motivated public health cadre, as well 
      as truly integrated surveillance and epidemic response infrastructure, for dengue 
      and beyond.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue fever is one of the most rapidly advancing viral vector-borne 
      diseases worldwide and vaccine candidates are in the final stages of clinical 
      trials, representing a decisive opportunity to control the disease. To decide 
      whether and where to support the introduction of new vaccines it is crucial to 
      assess costs imposed by the disease and cost-effectiveness of vaccine programmes. 
      OBJECTIVE: To identify economic evidence about dengue fever immunization, by 
      systematic review, to assist future policy decisions and investment. METHODS: The 
      electronic search stage was conducted on PubMed/Medline, Embase, Web of Science, 
      Global Health, NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) and Latin American and 
      Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) databases. Searches were restricted to 
      papers published between January 1970 and February 2016. Selected papers were 
      quality assessed using three recognized checklists. RESULTS: Eleven relevant studies 
      were identified and there is economic evidence of a satisfactory quality level, 
      derived through modelling approaches, to conclude that dengue fever vaccines will be 
      economically advantageous when compared to vector preventive strategies, despite 
      uncertainties surrounding vaccine efficacy and costs per vaccine dose. Quality 
      assessment based on checklists showed similar findings and although overall quality 
      was considered satisfactory, there were relevant methodological issues not 
      considered among studies reviewed. CONCLUSION: Several uncertainties still remain 
      about effectiveness of dengue fever vaccines; however, the reviewed economic 
      evidence suggests that, when available, the vaccine can be economically advantageous 
      at moderate prices. Future research needs to confirm findings from the economic 
      models by using actual costs and effectiveness data.

AB  - Prediction and prevention of dengue epidemics are based on informations gathered 
      about the mosquito vector species, the dengue types transmitted, the vertebrate 
      hosts and their environment. Although Aedes aegypti is the most important vector, 
      other Aedes may also propagate the dengue viruses. The populations of vector 
      mosquitoes are evaluated through several indices: Breteau and/or positive house 
      index, number of indoor resting Aedes females, etc.... The four dengue types can 
      replicate in vertebrate hosts beside humans and in other mosquito species than Ae. 
      aegypti. The incidence of dengue on a population is largely variable according to 
      the immunity status, the vector competence and the virus strains. Concomitant 
      infections by two types of dengue virus or by an another pathogen (Alphavirus) have 
      been observed. The environmental factors influencing the dengue ecosystem are mostly 
      climatic (temperature, rainfall, wind) but also anthropic (transportation means, 
      public buildings). Prevention of dengue epidemics must be based on public health 
      education in schools, community participation, epidemiological surveillance linked 
      with good vector control teams. Nevertheless intensive research on dengue and the 
      actions undertaken for the last forty years, dengue remains the first cause of viral 
      morbidity worldwide.

TI  - Consequences of the expanding global distribution of Aedes albopictus for dengue 
      virus transmission.
PG  - e646
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0000646 [doi]
LID - e646
AB  - The dramatic global expansion of Aedes albopictus in the last three decades has 
      increased public health concern because it is a potential vector of numerous 
      arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses), including the most prevalent arboviral 
      pathogen of humans, dengue virus (DENV). Ae. aegypti is considered the primary DENV 
      vector and has repeatedly been incriminated as a driving force in dengue's worldwide 
      emergence. What remains unresolved is the extent to which Ae. albopictus contributes 
      to DENV transmission and whether an improved understanding of its vector status 
      would enhance dengue surveillance and prevention. To assess the relative public 
      health importance of Ae. albopictus for dengue, we carried out two complementary 
      analyses. We reviewed its role in past dengue epidemics and compared its DENV vector 
      competence with that of Ae. aegypti. Observations from "natural experiments" 
      indicate that, despite seemingly favorable conditions, places where Ae. albopictus 
      predominates over Ae. aegypti have never experienced a typical explosive dengue 
      epidemic with severe cases of the disease. Results from a meta-analysis of 
      experimental laboratory studies reveal that although Ae. albopictus is overall more 
      susceptible to DENV midgut infection, rates of virus dissemination from the midgut 
      to other tissues are significantly lower in Ae. albopictus than in Ae. aegypti. For 
      both indices of vector competence, a few generations of mosquito colonization appear 
      to result in a relative increase of Ae. albopictus susceptibility, which may have 
      been a confounding factor in the literature. Our results lead to the conclusion that 
      Ae. albopictus plays a relatively minor role compared to Ae. aegypti in DENV 
      transmission, at least in part due to differences in host preferences and reduced 
      vector competence. Recent examples of rapid arboviral adaptation to alternative 
      mosquito vectors, however, call for cautious extrapolation of our conclusion. Vector 
      status is a dynamic process that in the future could change in epidemiologically 
      important ways.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is the most common arboviral disease in the tropical and 
      sub-tropical regions of the world. Like other regions, dengue-endemic areas have 
      faced the additional public health and socio-economic impact of the ongoing 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. COVID-19 and dengue co-infections have 
      been reported, with complicated patient management and care requirements. This 
      review aimed to collate and synthesise current knowledge on the clinical features 
      and outcomes of COVID-19 and dengue virus co-infection, a potentially important new 
      dimension to be considered in public health management of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
      METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science 
      and Scopus databases from 1st January to 21st November 2020. The key search terms 
      used were "dengue" and "coronavirus". Descriptive analysis with graphical 
      illustrations were used to present the clinical and laboratory parameters of the 
      co-infection. RESULTS: Thirteen published papers and four news articles were 
      included in the review. Most studies were case reports with a detailed description 
      of the clinical and laboratory characteristics of the co-infection. All cases were 
      in adults with the exception of a six-year old child. The common symptoms of 
      co-infection were fever, dyspnea, headache, and cough. Common laboratory results 
      included thrombocytopenia, lymphocytopenia, elevated transaminases, and leukopenia. 
      Serious outcomes of co-infection included septic shock, acute respiratory disease 
      syndrome and multi-organ failure, leading to death in some patients. CONCLUSIONS: 
      COVID-19 and dengue co-infection was associated with severe disease and fatal 
      outcomes. The correct diagnosis and treatment of co-infection poses a substantial 
      challenge due to the overlapping clinical and laboratory parameters. Therefore, 
      confirmative diagnostic tests are necessary for accurate and timely diagnosis and 
      patient management.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Progression of dengue is often associated with thrombocytopenia 
      resulting from viral-induced bone marrow suppression and immune-mediated peripheral 
      platelet consumption. Immature platelet fraction (IPF), which can be measured using 
      a haematology analyser, is a precursor indicating platelet formation in the bone 
      marrow. This study evaluated the trend of IPF as an early recovery indicator of 
      platelets in dengue patients with thrombocytopenia, and its relationship with severe 
      dengue in conjunction with reticulocyte count. METHODS: Hospitalized patients with 
      dengue were enrolled and followed-up daily until discharge. Blood investigations 
      included daily full blood counts and IPF measured using a haematology analyser. 
      RESULTS: In total, 287 patients with confirmed dengue were enrolled in this study, 
      25 of whom had severe dengue. All patients had a decreasing trend in platelet count 
      in the first week of illness, concomitant with an increasing trend in the percentage 
      of immature platelets to total platelets (IPF%) for more than 3 days prior to 
      platelet recovery. IPF% was significantly increased in patients with severe dengue 
      compared with patients with non-severe dengue on days 3-5 after the onset of fever. 
      Reticulocyte count increased significantly in patients with severe dengue on day 5. 
      CONCLUSIONS: IPF can be utilized as an early recovery indicator of platelets in 
      patients with dengue and thrombocytopenia.

TI  - Alternate hypothesis on the pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)/dengue 
      shock syndrome (DSS) in dengue virus infection.
PG  - 401-8
LID - 10.3181/0707-MR-198 [doi]
AB  - Dengue fever, caused by infection with dengue virus, is not a new disease, but 
      recently because of its serious emerging health threats, coupled with possible dire 
      consequences including death, it has aroused considerable medical and public health 
      concerns worldwide. Today, dengue is considered one of the most important 
      arthropod-borne viral diseases in humans in terms of morbidity and mortality. 
      Globally, it is estimated that approximate 50 to 100 million new dengue virus 
      infections occur annually. Among these, there are 200,000 to 500,000 cases of 
      potential life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)/dengue shock syndrome 
      (DSS), characterized by thrombocytopenia and increased vascular permeability. The 
      death rate associated with the more severe form DHF/DSS is approximately 5%, 
      predominantly in children under the age of 15. Although intensive efforts have been 
      made to study the early clinical pathophysiology of dengue infection with the 
      objective to identify the potential cause of DHF, results or data that have 
      accumulated from different regions of the world involving studies of different 
      ethnicity groups are inconsistent at present in terms of identifying a unified 
      hypothesis for the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS. Thus, the potential mechanisms involved 
      in the pathogenesis of DHF and DSS remain elusive. The purpose of this review is to 
      identify alternate factors, such as innate immune parameters, hyper-thermal factors, 
      conditioning of neutralizing antibody, concept of vector transmission, and physical 
      status of virus in viremic patients that may play a role in the induction of DHF and 
      DSS, which might have directly or indirectly contributed to the discrepancies that 
      are noted in the literature reported to date. It is the hope that identification of 
      an alternative explanation for the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS will pave the way for the 
      institution of new strategies for the prevention of this complicated disease.

TI  - Emergence of the severe syndrome and mortality associated with dengue and 
      dengue-like illness: historical records (1890 to 1950) and their compatibility with 
      current hypotheses on the shift of disease manifestation.
PG  - 186-201, Table of Contents
LID - 10.1128/CMR.00052-08 [doi]
AB  - Outbreaks of the severe dengue syndrome, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), emerged 
      beginning in the 1950s, marking a dramatic change in the dengue syndrome. While 
      intense investigations in multiple directions have been conducted for many years to 
      elucidate the intrinsic mechanisms conducive to the development of DHF, no consensus 
      has yet emerged. Meanwhile, relatively little attention has been paid to the 
      occurrence of severe dengue and death prior to the 1950s. This comprehensive review 
      was designed to evaluate outbreak records in the early dengue history to better 
      understand the epidemiologic background and other factors that existed before the 
      emergence of DHF outbreaks. By applying a set of stringent criteria to remove 
      unreliable data as much as possible and by interpreting the results conservatively, 
      a short list of etiologically more reliable outbreaks with high mortality was 
      obtained. The results show that severe dengue syndrome, clinically very much 
      compatible with DHF, occurred far more frequently in multiple locations than it had 
      been assumed before; that the magnitudes of mortality in several outbreaks were not 
      negligible; and that the epidemiologic background features shared among these 
      outbreaks in the early period were, with the exceptions of more limited demographic 
      changes, generally similar to the post-1950 conditions.

AB  - Dengue is a major global health concern. Its increasing incidence and continued 
      geographical spread make the development of an effective vaccine an international 
      health priority. Dengue is currently present in more than one hundred countries, 
      while up to 3 billion people are estimated to be at risk of infection. In addition, 
      dengue is associated with a substantial economic burden that is particularly severe 
      at the individual family level. Establishing the full human cost and economic impact 
      of dengue remains urgent. The approaches being investigated for vaccine development 
      include the use of live, vectored and killed, and recombinant preparations. Vaccine 
      candidates must provide broad and robust immunity to all four dengue serotypes 
      simultaneously as secondary dengue infections may lead to enhanced disease severity. 
      The design, implementation, and surveillance measures associated with dengue vaccine 
      trials need to be particularly rigorous due to the complexity of the disease and its 
      epidemiology. Therefore, eligible trial sites must satisfy several criteria 
      including documented hyper-endemicity and a known epidemiological history of the 
      circulating serotypes. Epidemiological data from Ratchaburi province in Thailand 
      strongly support this location's suitability for a proof-of-concept efficacy trial 
      of the sanofi pasteur tetravalent dengue vaccine. Accurate disease surveillance and 
      carefully monitored clinical trials will provide essential evidence concerning the 
      efficacy of candidate dengue vaccines, which will hopefully herald a new era in 
      dengue disease prevention.

      systematic literature review.
PG  - 621-634
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.13-0676 [doi]
AB  - The 1997 and 2009 WHO dengue case classifications were compared in a systematic 
      review with 12 eligible studies (4 prospective). Ten expert opinion articles were 
      used for discussion. For the 2009 WHO classification studies show: when determining 
      severe dengue sensitivity ranges between 59-98% (88%/98%: prospective studies), 
      specificity between 41-99% (99%: prospective study) - comparing the 1997 WHO 
      classification: sensitivity 24.8-89.9% (24.8%/74%: prospective studies), 
      specificity: 25%/100% (100%: prospective study). The application of the 2009 WHO 
      classification is easy, however for (non-severe) dengue there may be a risk of 
      monitoring increased case numbers. Warning signs validation studies are needed. For 
      epidemiological/pathogenesis research use of the 2009 WHO classification, opinion 
      papers show that ease of application, increased sensitivity (severe dengue) and 
      international comparability are advantageous; 3 severe dengue criteria (severe 
      plasma leakage, severe bleeding, severe organ manifestation) are useful research 
      endpoints. The 2009 WHO classification has clear advantages for clinical use, use in 
      epidemiology is promising and research use may at least not be a disadvantage.

PG  - 165-8
AB  - From 2005 to 2013, there were 15 dengue patients aged over 60 years old who were 
      admitted to Photharam Hospital, Ratchaburi, Thailand. Ten were females and five were 
      males. Nine had dengue fever (DF), and 6 had dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). A 
      trending shift in age group towards adults has been seen during the past decades. No 
      deaths were seen in these elderly patients with dengue disease, indicating early 
      recognition and effective management of these dengue patients. The trend towards 
      higher age in dengue patients is a problem of concern, which needs further 
      elaboration.

TI  - Dengue in the Western Hemisphere.
PG  - 107-28
AB  - Dengue is an important insect-borne viral disease, transmitted in the Western 
      hemisphere by the A. aegypti mosquito. It is endemic in the Caribbean with sporadic 
      outbreaks in different regions. Cases in the United States are mostly imported cases 
      but can be seen in the Gulf states as well as the Southeast. Dengue is most 
      frequently a self-limiting illness characterized by sudden onset of fever, chills, 
      headache, retroocular pain, general malaise, myalgias, arthralgias, and a skin rash. 
      In a small group of patients, the same viruses may cause dengue hemorrhagic fever 
      and dengue shock syndrome. In the Western hemisphere, dengue with hemorrhagic 
      manifestations and dengue with shock syndrome have been documented frequently in 
      adults. There are four serotypes of dengue viruses and all have been documented to 
      be present in the Western hemisphere. The clinical illness is similar for any of the 
      four serotypes; after infection there is lifelong homotypic immunity and heterotypic 
      immunity for several months. The diagnosis of dengue is based on clinical findings 
      and can be confirmed by serologic tests or virus isolation. There is no specific 
      treatment for dengue; hydration is important as well as aggressive fluid management 
      if hypotension develops. It is important to avoid aspirin and salicylates. The best 
      treatment is prevention through mosquito control and public education to eradicate 
      the breeding grounds for the mosquito.

TI  - Reviewing the development, evidence base, and application of the revised dengue case 
      classification.
PG  - 94-101
LID - 10.1179/2047773212Y.0000000017 [doi]
AB  - With the example of dengue, an evidence-based approach to prospectively develop a 
      case classification is described, gathering evidence for identifying strength and 
      weaknesses of the existing model, collecting new data describing the disease as it 
      occurs globally, further developing a new model that can be applied in practice and 
      field testing the newly developed model in comparison to the previous model. For 
      each step in this process, the highest available level of evidence has been applied. 
      This process has been initiated by the World Health Organization's (WHO) Special 
      Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) and WHO's Department 
      for Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD), developing the following for 
      dengue. Since the early 1970s, dengue has been classified into dengue fever, dengue 
      haemorrhagic fever grades I and II and dengue shock syndrome grades III and IV 
      (DF/DHF/DSS). However, in recent years, a growing number of dengue clinicians have 
      questioned the shortcomings of this scheme. The issues have revolved around the 
      complexity of confirming DHF in clinical practice, misclassifying severe cases as 
      DF, and the emphasis on haemorrhage rather than plasma leakage as the underlying 
      problem in most severe dengue cases. Step 1: A systematic literature review 
      highlighted the shortcomings of the DF/DHF/DSS scheme: (1) difficulties in applying 
      the criteria for DHF/DSS; (2) the tourniquet test has a low sensitivity for 
      distinguishing between DHF and DF; and (3) most DHF criteria had a large variability 
      in frequency of occurrence. Step 2: An analysis of regional and national dengue 
      guidelines and their application in the clinical practice showed a need to 
      re-evaluate and standardize guidelines as the actual ones showed a large variation 
      of definitions, an inconsistent application by medical staff, and a lack of 
      diagnostic facilities necessary for the DHF diagnosis in frontline services. Step 3: 
      A prospective cohort study in seven countries, confirmed the difficulties in 
      applying the DF/DHF/DSS criteria even in tertiary care hospitals, that DF/DHF/DSS do 
      not represent levels of disease severity and that a clear distinction between severe 
      dengue (defined by plasma leakage and/or severe haemorrhage, and/or organ failure) 
      and (non-severe) dengue can be made using highly sensitive and specific criteria. In 
      contrast, the sub-grouping of (non-severe) dengue into two further severity levels 
      was only possible with criteria that gave approximately 70% sensitivity and 
      specificity. Step 4: Three regional expert consensus groups in the Americas and Asia 
      concluded that 'dengue is one disease entity with different clinical presentations 
      and often with unpredictable clinical evolution and outcome' and that, revising the 
      results of Step 3, DF/DHF/DSS is not related to disease severity. Step 5: In a 
      global expert consensus meeting at WHO in Geneva/Switzerland the evidence collected 
      in Steps 1-4 was reviewed and a revised scheme was developed and accepted, 
      distinguishing: dengue with or without warning signs and severe dengue; the further 
      field testing and acquisition of further prospective evidence of the revised scheme 
      was recommended. Step 6: In 18 countries, the usefulness and applicability of the 
      revised classification compared to the DF/DHF/DSS scheme were tested showing clear 
      results in favour of the revised classification. Step 7: Studies are under way on 
      the predictive value of warning signs for severe dengue and on criteria for the 
      clinical diagnosis of dengue which will complete the evidence foundation of the 
      revised classification. The analysis has shown that the revised dengue case 
      classification is better able to standardize clinical management, raise awareness 
      about unnecessary interventions, match patient categories with specific treatment 
      instructions, and make the key messages of patient management understandable for all 
      health care staff dealing with dengue patients. Furthermore, the evidence-based 
      approach to develop prospectively the dengue case classification could be a model 
      approach for other disease classifications.

TI  - REPORTING PROGRESS ON THE USE OF THE WHO 2009 DENGUE CASE CLASSIFICATION: A REVIEW.
PG  - 49-54
AB  - This review reports on the progress in the use of the WHO 2009 dengue case 
      classification--dengue and severe dengue--following up on a previous review 
      (Horstick et al, 2012). The previous review detailed Steps 1 - 5 in developing the 
      2009 WHO case classification. As a further step, a systematic review of published 
      studies comparing the two classifications has been published with 12 studies and a 
      further 10 expert opinion papers that recommend the use of the 2009 WHO dengue case 
      classification for clinical management, epidemiology, and clinical research. 
      Furthermore, a formal expert consensus was reached in La Habana, Cuba in 2013 with 
      dengue experts from the Americas, sharing experiences that applied the 2009 WHO 
      dengue case classification. The expert panel recommended to 1) update ICD10, 2) 
      include the 2009 WHO case classification in country epidemiological reports 
      globally, and 3) implement studies improving sensitivity/specificity of the dengue 
      case definition.

AB  - The global burden of dengue and its geographic distribution have increased over the 
      past several decades. The introduction of dengue in new areas has often been 
      accompanied by high case-fatality rates. Drawing on the experience in managing 
      dengue cases at the Queen Sirikit National Institute of Child Health in Bangkok, 
      Thailand, this article provides the authors' perspectives on key clinical lessons to 
      improve dengue-related outcomes. Parallels between this clinical experience and 
      outcomes reported in randomized controlled trials, results of efforts to disseminate 
      practice recommendations, and suggestions for areas for further research are also 
      discussed.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The spread of dengue (DEN) worldwide combined with an increased 
      severity of the DEN-associated clinical outcomes has made this mosquito-borne virus 
      of great global public health importance. This article reviews the latest findings 
      in the field of DEN pathogenesis, vector control and vaccine development. RECENT 
      FINDINGS: Atypical clinical manifestations as well as a shift in the age of 
      DEN-infected patients have forced a revisit of the current definitions and 
      classifications of the DEN-associated diseases. The antibody-mediated 
      internalization of DEN virus triggers intracellular pathways that further enhance 
      viral replication and output. A correlation between the human leukocyte antigen 
      system and disease severity was found. The development of tetravalent DEN vaccine 
      candidates is reaching its final stages, though the antibody levels required to 
      protect against the four DEN serotypes are still unknown. SUMMARY: Efforts have been 
      devoted to identify the host target cells that are permissive or resistant to DEN 
      virus replication and to decipher the downstream events that would result in either 
      disease enhancement or protection. Strong emphasis has recently been made on genetic 
      polymorphisms that confer DEN protection versus susceptibility to severe DEN. The 
      increasing knowledge gained from basic science should help to better design 
      effective DEN vaccines.

AB  - Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease that threatens over half of the world's 
      population. Despite being endemic to more than 100 countries, government-led efforts 
      and tools for timely identification and tracking of new infections are still lacking 
      in many affected areas. Multiple methodologies that leverage the use of 
      Internet-based data sources have been proposed as a way to complement dengue 
      surveillance efforts. Among these, dengue-related Google search trends have been 
      shown to correlate with dengue activity. We extend a methodological framework, 
      initially proposed and validated for flu surveillance, to produce near real-time 
      estimates of dengue cases in five countries/states: Mexico, Brazil, Thailand, 
      Singapore and Taiwan. Our result shows that our modeling framework can be used to 
      improve the tracking of dengue activity in multiple locations around the world.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is an important emerging and re-emerging arboviral infection 
      globally as a rapidly growing and widespread public health problem, with 
      transmission occurring in more than 128 countries in Asia, Americas, southeast 
      Africa, western Pacific, and eastern Mediterranean regions. Therefore, the aim of 
      this study was to characterize and quantify the scientific output of dengue research 
      in Arab countries relative to that worldwide by using a bibliometric analysis. 
      METHODS: The standardized search approach based on the use of the the keyword 
      "dengue" in the title, abstract, and keyword field was used to get research output 
      related to dengue at a global level. All data related to dengue were collected from 
      the past to December 31, 2015. RESULTS: A total of 19,581 dengue-related documents 
      identified in the Scopus database. The results show that the study of dengue 
      exhibits an overall upward trend from 1872 to 2015 with peak publications in 2014. 
      The leading countries in dengue research were the USA (4,709; 24.05 %), India 
      (1,942; 9.92 %), Brazil (1,530; 7.81 %), Thailand (1,260; 6.43 %), the UK (1,129; 
      5.77 %), and France (1,087; 5.55 %). Only 226 (1.16 % of the overall global research 
      effort in the dengue field) articles were published from the Arab region. The total 
      number of citations for all publications was 352,710, with an average of 18.0 
      citations per publication. Furthermore, the h-index for all extracted data related 
      to dengue research was 186. Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) was the most productive 
      country in Arab region with 102 documents representing 45.1 %. Furthermore, the 
      h-index for all extracted data related to dengue research was 27. The USA was Arab's 
      most main cooperative partner (46, 20.4 %), followed by India (36, 15.9 %). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The amount of literature related to dengue research has considerably 
      increased over the last decade. This bibliometric analysis has demonstrated the 
      leading role that the USA, India, Brazil, Thailand, the UK, and France play in 
      dengue research. The Arab world produced fewer publications related to dengue with 
      lower quality than other world countries.

TI  - Dengue haemorrhagic fever in Singapore.
PG  - 91-8
AB  - The history of dengue haemorrhagic fever as distinct from dengue fever in South-East 
      Asia is traced. The epidemiology of the disease in the various countries is 
      contrasted with that in Singapore since DHF first appeared on the scene in 
      South-East Asia. From this survey, it is concluded that the dengue haemorrhagic 
      fever is a new disease presentation, and its fate in SE Asia depends on the 
      immunological state of the community, attempts at vector control, and probably 
      antigenic variation in the various types of dengue virus. The pathogenetic 
      mechanisms are discussed in detail. Diagnosis is presented with a detailed 
      discussion of diagnosis of the pre-shock stage. Finally, the management of dengue 
      haemorrhagic fever is discussed.

TI  - DENGUE WITH CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM INVOLVEMENT.
PG  - 118-22
AB  - Dengue has spread to new geographic areas affecting both children and adults, and it 
      has become a global threat. Dengue with central nervous system involvement includes 
      febrile seizures, encephalopathy, encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, intracranial 
      hemorrhages, intracranial thrombosis, subdural effusions, mononeuropathies, 
      polyneuropathies, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and transverse myelitis. These 
      manifestations may be associated with co-infections, co-morbidities, or 
      complications of prolonged shock. It is important to consider dengue as a cause for 
      the above neurological presentations, particularly in endemic territories for dengue 
      disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue infection among travelers has become one of the most public 
      health concerns in present days. The importation of dengue virus can initiate an 
      outbreak in non-endemic regions. Thailand is one of the countries topping the list 
      of highest dengue infections in travelers. METHOD: This study estimates the risk of 
      dengue infection among travelers during their visit in Thailand by using a 
      mathematical model with seasonal variations. RESULTS: The risk of dengue infection 
      in high dengue season is 2.50-4.07 times that on low dengue season depending on the 
      locations. The average daily risk of dengue infections of Thailand per 100,000 
      travelers is 2.14 and 7.03 for low and high dengue season, respectively. The highest 
      rate of infection is Rayong and the lowest rate is Sing Buri. Several popular 
      tourist provinces are high dengue endemic areas. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides 
      useful information on dengue infection among travelers. The main factors are the 
      time of arrival in the year, the duration of stay of the travelers and the locations 
      where the travelers spend most of their time.

AB  - As tourism is the mainstay of the Maldives' economy, this country recognizes the 
      importance of controlling mosquito-borne diseases in an environmentally responsible 
      manner. This study sought to estimate the economic costs of dengue in this Small 
      Island Developing State of 417,492 residents. The authors reviewed relevant 
      available documents on dengue epidemiology and conducted site visits and interviews 
      with public health offices, health centers, referral hospitals, health insurers, and 
      drug distribution organizations. An average of 1,543 symptomatic dengue cases was 
      reported annually from 2011 through 2016. Intensive waste and water management on a 
      resort island cost $1.60 per occupied room night. Local vector control programs on 
      inhabited islands cost $35.93 for waste collection and $7.89 for household visits by 
      community health workers per person per year. Ambulatory care for a dengue episode 
      cost $49.87 at a health center, while inpatient episodes averaged $127.74 at a 
      health center, $1,164.78 at a regional hospital, and $1,655.50 at a tertiary 
      referral hospital. Overall, the cost of dengue illness in the Maldives in 2015 was 
      $2,495,747 (0.06% of gross national income, GNI, or $6.10 per resident) plus 
      $1,338,141 (0.03% of GNI or $3.27 per resident) for dengue surveillance. With 
      tourism generating annual income of $898 and tax revenues of $119 per resident, 
      results of an international analysis suggest that the risk of dengue lowers the 
      country's gross annual income by $110 per resident (95% confidence interval $50 to 
      $160) and its annual tax receipts by $14 per resident (95% confidence interval $7 to 
      $22). Many innovative vector control efforts are affordable and could decrease 
      future costs of dengue illness in the Maldives.

AB  - In history disease has caused social and economic damage. Dengue is an illness 
      typically found in the tropics that has affected more and more people. In Brazil, 
      according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), in 2013 at 
      least 12.9% of the population (25.8 million) reported already having had dengue in 
      their life. So, how wide are the economic impacts that dengue's contagion has on the 
      gross national product? Using Leontief's method, it became possible to estimate the 
      direct and indirect impact on the workforce and output by one country. Workforce 
      absenteeism reduced the national productiveness and welfare state where we found 
      maximum inoperability of 0.027% and a minimum of 0.002%. This paper develops a 
      methodology for estimation of the impact dengue has incurred in each sector of an 
      economy; designing a ranking with sectors that have been more affected and 
      forecasting the propagation of the endemic throughout a region. This research 
      measures the impact of dengue on economy, the result was that the total loss of the 
      Brazilian economy in 2013 was around BRL 1,023,174,876.83; the importance of 0.02% 
      of the Gross Domestic Product.

AB  - The vector for dengue fever and chikungunya, Aedes albopictus, was recently 
      identified in Southeastern France, although the usual vector for dengue fever is 
      Aedes aegypti, raising the possibility of cases occurring among the local population 
      via viraemic individuals returning from endemic areas. Dengue fever is usually 
      transmitted by Aedes aegypti. It is due to an arbovirus-flavivirus of which four 
      different serotypes are known: Den 1 to 4. Each serotype is responsible for specific 
      prolonged immunity but no cross-reactivity exists between serotypes. Clinically, the 
      onset is abrupt with frontal headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, joint pain, 
      prostration and, in many cases, a macular rash usually sparing the face and 
      extremities. Haemorrhagic signs may occur, such as petechiae, purpura, epistaxis or 
      bleeding gingivae. Two severe forms of dengue fever, particularly among children 
      below 3 years of age, include dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and DHF with shock 
      (dengue shock syndrome). If a case is suspected in metropolitan France, the 
      diagnosis should be systematically confirmed by positive specific IgM, RT-PCR or 
      viral isolation. Treatment of dengue fever, whether in its uncomplicated form or 
      with hemorrhagic manifestations or shock, remains symptomatic. There is no specific 
      anti-viral treatment. A case should be notified to allow French health authorities 
      to take the appropriate measures for vector control.

TI  - Clinical and Laboratory Profile of Dengue in Kashmir Valley.
PG  - 11-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: As majority of cases of dengue are associated with thrombocytopenia, it 
      is indispensable to study clinical presentation, biochemical parameters and outcome 
      of dengue fever in a population known with low platelet count. METHODOLOGY: A 
      prospective observational study was conducted from September 2016 to August 2017that 
      included forty NS-1 antigen (IgM) Dengue positive patients. Clinical features, 
      laboratory parameters and outcome of dengue patients were noted. RESULTS: All the 
      patients had travel history outside the valley into the neighbouring state. Most 
      patients (70%) had duration of stay between 21-30 days in dengue prevalent areas 
      before catching the illness. Duration of symptoms was between 4-9 days in majority 
      of patients (92.5%). Most patients (85%) presented in months of September to 
      November. The three most common symptoms were fever (100%), chills (92.5%) and 
      headache (80%). The most common laboratory features were thrombocytopenia (97.5%), 
      leukopenia (87.5%), transaminitis (87.5%) and raised LDH (32.5%). One patient 
      developed Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF). All patients recovered completely. 
      CONCLUSION: DF in Kashmir is seen exclusively in travellers to other states 
      especially in the monsoon season.DF in Kashmiri patients has a favourable outcome 
      despite low baseline platelet count. DHF is uncommon in Kashmiri population.

AB  - Dengue is one of the most important and wide-spread viral infections affecting human 
      populations. The last few decades have seen a dramatic increase in the global burden 
      of dengue, with the virus now being endemic or near-endemic in over 100 countries 
      world-wide. A recombinant tetravalent vaccine candidate (CYD-TDV) has recently 
      completed Phase III clinical efficacy trials in South East Asia and Latin America 
      and has been licensed for use in several countries. The trial results showed 
      moderate-to-high efficacies in protection against clinical symptoms and 
      hospitalisation but with so far unknown effects on transmission and infections per 
      se. Model-based predictions about the vaccine's short- or long-term impact on the 
      burden of dengue are therefore subject to a considerable degree of uncertainty. 
      Furthermore, different immune interactions between dengue's serotypes have 
      frequently been evoked by modelling studies to underlie dengue's oscillatory 
      dynamics in disease incidence and serotype prevalence. Here we show how model 
      assumptions regarding immune interactions in the form of antibody-dependent 
      enhancement, temporary cross-immunity and the number of infections required to 
      develop full immunity can significantly affect the predicted outcome of a dengue 
      vaccination campaign. Our results thus re-emphasise the important gap in our current 
      knowledge concerning the effects of previous exposure on subsequent dengue 
      infections and further suggest that intervention impact studies should be critically 
      evaluated by their underlying assumptions about serotype immune-interactions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to develop multiple prediction tools 
      that calculate the risk of developing dengue haemorrhagic fever. METHODS: Training 
      data consisted of 1771 individuals from 2006-2008 admitted with dengue fever whereby 
      304 developed dengue haemorrhagic fever during hospitalisation. Least absolute 
      shrinkage and selection operator regression was used to construct three types of 
      calculators, static admission calculators and dynamic calculators that predict the 
      risk of developing dengue haemorrhagic fever for a subsequent day (DAily Risk 
      Tomorrow [DART]) or for any future point after a specific day since fever onset 
      (DAily Risk Ever [DARE]). RESULTS: From 119 admission covariates, 35 were in at 
      least one of the calculators, which reported area under the curve (AUC) values of at 
      least 0.72. Addition of person-time data for DART improved AUC to 0.76. DARE 
      calculators displayed a large increase in AUC to 0.79 past day 7 with the inclusion 
      of a strong predictor, maximum temperature on day 6 since onset, indicative of a 
      saddleback fever. CONCLUSIONS: All calculators performed well when validated with 
      2005 data. Addition of daily variables further improved the accuracy. These 
      calculators can be used in tandem to assess the risk of dengue haemorrhagic fever 
      upon admission and updated daily to obtain more precise risk estimates.

AB  - Dengue virus infections are a major cause of febrile illness that significantly 
      affects individual and societal productivity and drives up health care costs 
      principally in the developing world. Two dengue vaccine candidates are in advanced 
      clinical efficacy trials in Latin America and Asia, and another has been licensed in 
      more than fifteen countries but its uptake has been limited. Despite these advances, 
      standardized metrics for comparability of protective efficacy between dengue 
      vaccines remain poorly defined. The Dengue Illness Index (DII) is a tool that we 
      developed thru refinement of previous similar iterations in an attempt to improve 
      and standardize the measurement of vaccine and drug efficacy in reducing moderate 
      dengue illness. The tool is designed to capture an individual's overall disease 
      experience based on how the totality of their symptoms impacts their general 
      wellness and daily functionality. We applied the DII to a diary card, the Dengue 
      Illness Card (DIC), which was examined and further developed by a working group. The 
      card was then refined with feedback garnered from a Delphi methodology-based query 
      that addressed the adequacy and applicability of the tool in clinical dengue 
      research. There was overall agreement that the tool would generate useful data and 
      provide an alternative perspective to the assessment of drug or vaccine candidates, 
      which in the case of vaccines, are assessed by their reduction in any virologically 
      confirmed dengue of any severity with a focus on the more severe. The DIC needs to 
      be evaluated in the field in the context of vaccine or drug trials, prospective 
      cohort studies, or during experimental human infection studies. Here, we present the 
      final DIC resulting from the Delphi process and offer its further development or use 
      to the dengue research community.

PG  - 305-10
AB  - The growing problem of widespread viral infections is a challenge for modern 
      medicine. Emerging reports of dengue virus infections in Europe create a new 
      epidemic problem. The virus responsible for causing the symptoms of the disease is 
      transmitted by mosquitoes. Over 50% of the world's population lives in areas where 
      the risk of dengue feveris high. In total, according to WHO, infected with dengue is 
      2.4 million people and outbreaks of endemic diseases are present in 100 countries 
      that threaten the 2.5 billion population. There are four serotypes of dengue virus, 
      which belong to the family Flaviviridae and the type of Flavirus. Serotypes are 
      known as DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4. Contact each of the serotypes of the 
      virus causes long-lasting resistance to the other, and each of them is responsible 
      for the induction of disease epidemics, including severe cases. In the first stage 
      of the disease should seek to replace lost fluids and electrolytes. Because of the 
      elevated body temperature is recommended to administer paracetamol formulations and 
      the use of cold compresses. Contraindicated is the use of aspirin and non-steroidal 
      anti-inflammatory drugs. In severe forms of dengue patients absolutely should be 
      hospitalized and treatment in the intensive care centers. In the treatment of shock, 
      it is recommended that the administration of isotonic crystalloid fluids at 5-10 
      ml/kg/hr. under the control of hematocrit and fill peripheral microcirculation. The 
      administration of blood products for the large current is required to control 
      bleeding. Dengue vaccine containing DEN-DEN chimeras is still at the stage of 
      preclinical studies.

AB  - With approximately half of the world's population at risk of contracting dengue, 
      this mosquito-borne disease is of global concern. International travellers 
      significantly contribute to dengue's rapid and large-scale spread by importing the 
      disease from endemic into non-endemic countries. To prevent future outbreaks and 
      dengue from establishing in non-endemic countries, knowledge about the arrival time 
      and location of infected travellers is crucial. We propose a network model that 
      predicts the monthly number of dengue-infected air passengers arriving at any given 
      airport. We consider international air travel volumes to construct weighted 
      networks, representing passenger flows between airports. We further calculate the 
      probability of passengers, who travel through the international air transport 
      network, being infected with dengue. The probability of being infected depends on 
      the destination, duration and timing of travel. Our findings shed light onto dengue 
      importation routes and reveal country-specific reporting rates that have been until 
      now largely unknown. This paper provides important new knowledge about the spreading 
      dynamics of dengue that is highly beneficial for public health authorities to 
      strategically allocate the often limited resources to more efficiently prevent the 
      spread of dengue.

TI  - Dengue Incidence and Sociodemographic Conditions in Pucallpa, Peruvian Amazon: What 
      Role for Modification of the Dengue-Temperature Relationship?
PG  - 180-190
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.19-0033 [doi]
AB  - Dengue is a climate-sensitive disease with an increasing global burden. Although the 
      relationship between meteorological conditions and dengue incidence is well 
      established, less is known about the modifying nature of sociodemographic variables 
      on that relationship. We assess the strength and direction of sociodemographic 
      effect modification of the temperature-dengue relationship in the second largest 
      city of the Peruvian Amazon to identify populations that may have heightened 
      vulnerability to dengue under varying climate conditions. We used weekly dengue 
      counts and averaged meteorological variables to evaluate the association between 
      disease incidence, meteorological exposures, and sociodemographic effect modifiers 
      (gender, age, and district) in negative binomial regression models. District was 
      included to consider geographical effect modification. We found that being a young 
      child or elderly, being female, and living in the district of Manantay increased 
      dengue's incidence rate ratio (IRR) as a result of 1°C increase in weekly mean 
      temperature (IRR = 2.99, 95% CI: 1.99-4.50 for women less than 5 years old and IRR = 
      2.86, 95% CI: = 1.93-4.22 for women older than 65 years, both estimates valid for 
      the rainy season). The effect of temperature on dengue depended on season, with 
      stronger effects during rainy seasons. Sociodemographic variables can provide 
      options for intervention to mitigate health impacts with a changing climate. Our 
      results indicate that patterns of baseline risk between regions and sociodemographic 
      conditions can differ substantially from trends in climate sensitivity. These 
      results challenge the assumption that the distribution of climate change impacts 
      will be patterned similarly to existing social gradients in health.

AB  - Dengue fever is the most prevalent flavivirus infection in tropical and subtropical 
      areas of the world. It is transmitted by the haematophagous mosquito Aedes aegypti, 
      and it manifests clinically as classical dengue fever, dengue haemorrhagic fever and 
      dengue shock syndrome. Rarely, dengue can be associated with neurophthalmic 
      manifestations. We present the case of a 21-year-old woman, suffering from dengue 
      with an isolated abducens nerve palsy.

AB  - An extensive body of theory addresses the topic of pathogen virulence evolution, yet 
      few studies have empirically demonstrated the presence of fitness trade-offs that 
      would select for intermediate virulence. Here we show the presence of 
      transmission-clearance trade-offs in dengue virus using viremia measurements. By 
      fitting a within-host model to these data, we further find that the interaction 
      between dengue and the host immune response can account for the observed trade-offs. 
      Finally, we consider dengue virulence evolution when selection acts on the virus's 
      production rate. By combining within-host model simulations with empirical findings 
      on how host viral load affects human-to-mosquito transmission success, we show that 
      the virus's transmission potential is maximized at production rates associated with 
      intermediate virulence and that the optimal production rate critically depends on 
      dengue's epidemiological context. These results indicate that long-term changes in 
      dengue's global distribution impact the invasion and spread of virulent dengue virus 
      genotypes.

TI  - Indonesian dengue burden estimates: review of evidence by an expert panel.
PG  - 2324-2329
LID - 10.1017/S0950268817001030 [doi]
AB  - Routine, passive surveillance systems tend to underestimate the burden of 
      communicable diseases such as dengue. When empirical methods are unavailable, 
      complimentary opinion-based or extrapolative methods have been employed. Here, an 
      expert Delphi panel estimated the proportion of dengue captured by the Indonesian 
      surveillance system, and associated health system parameters. Following presentation 
      of medical and epidemiological data and subsequent discussions, the panel made 
      iterative estimates from which expansion factors (EF), the ratio of total:reported 
      cases, were calculated. Panelists estimated that of all symptomatic Indonesian 
      dengue episodes, 57·8% (95% confidence interval (CI) 46·6-59·8) enter healthcare 
      facilities to seek treatment; 39·3% (95% CI 32·8-42·0) are diagnosed as dengue; and 
      20·3% (95% CI 16·1-24·3) are subsequently reported in the surveillance system. They 
      estimated most hospitalizations occur in the public sector, while ~55% of ambulatory 
      episodes are seen privately. These estimates gave an overall EF of 5·00; 
      hospitalized EF of 1·66; and ambulatory EF of 34·01 which, when combined with 
      passive surveillance data, equates to an annual average (2006-2015) of 612 005 
      dengue cases, and 183 297 hospitalizations. These estimates are lower than those 
      published elsewhere, perhaps due to case definitions, local clinical perceptions and 
      treatment-seeking behavior. These findings complement global burden estimates, 
      support health economic analyses, and can be used to inform decision-making.

TI  - Dengue fever among travelers.
PG  - 516-20
AB  - PURPOSE: The present paper describes the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of 
      dengue fever in a nonendemic population of travelers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical 
      manifestations, epidemiologic information, and laboratory findings are described for 
      a series of 18 Israeli travelers who tested serologically positive for dengue. 
      RESULTS: All the patients in the series contracted the disease in Southeast Asia, 
      mostly in Thailand; 30% had to be evacuated due to severe morbidity. The clinical 
      symptoms in travelers somewhat differ from the classical description among 
      endogenous populations. High fever, chills, extreme fatigue, and severe headaches 
      were prevalent. Other symptoms considered to be typical of dengue fever, such as 
      myalgia, arthralgia, rash, biphasic fever, were uncommon. Laboratory findings were 
      marked leukopenia, usually accompanied by lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, liver 
      function impairment, and hyponatremia. Some hemorrhagic phenomena were manifest 
      despite it being the first exposure, without mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Dengue fever 
      among the nonimmune has a somewhat different manifestation from that reported for 
      the Southeast Asian population. Although it is a significant cause for morbidity and 
      hospitalization, it is underestimated as a factor affecting traveler's health. More 
      efforts should be expended in developing an effective vaccine.

TI  - Dengue as a cause of acute undifferentiated fever in Vietnam.
PG  - 123
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is a common cause of fever in the tropics but its contribution to 
      the total burden of febrile illnesses that is presented to primary health facilities 
      in endemic regions such as Vietnam, is largely unknown. We aimed to report the 
      frequency of dengue as a cause of fever in Binh Thuan Province, to describe the 
      characteristics of dengue patients, and analyze the diagnostic accuracy of the 
      health care workers and the determinants of the diagnostic process. METHODS: All 
      patients presenting with acute undifferentiated fever at twelve community health 
      posts and one clinic at the provincial malaria station, Binh Thuan Province, a 
      dengue endemic province in southern Vietnam, were included. Record forms were used 
      to fill in patient and diseases characteristics, pre-referral treatment, signs and 
      symptoms, provisional diagnosis and prescribed treatment, referral and final 
      outcome. Serum samples were collected at first presentation and after 3 weeks for 
      serologic diagnosis. RESULTS: 2096 patients were included from April 2001 to March 
      2002. All 697 patients with paired serum samples were tested for dengue virus IgM 
      and IgG. Acute dengue was found in 33.6% cases and past dengue virus infections were 
      found in 57.1% cases. Acute primary infections were more common among children under 
      15 years old than among adults (7.7% vs. 3.5%, p value < 0.001). Younger age 
      significantly predicted acute dengue (RR per increasing year of age (95 % CI): 0.986 
      (0.975-0.997, p value = 0.014). 48.9% of cases with clinical diagnosis of acute 
      dengue were serologically confirmed and 32.5% of cases without clinical diagnosis of 
      acute dengue were positive by serology after all (OR = 1.981, p value 0.025, 95% CI: 
      1.079-3.635). Tourniquet test was not a predictor for dengue diagnosis. CONCLUSION: 
      Dengue is responsible for one third of the fevers presented to the public primary 
      health services in Binh Thuan, southern Vietnam. It presents as a highly unspecific 
      illness and is hardly recognized as a clinical entity by primary physicians.

TI  - Dengue: recent past and future threats.
LID - 10.1098/rstb.2013.0562 [doi]
LID - 20130562
AB  - This article explores four key questions about statistical models developed to 
      describe the recent past and future of vector-borne diseases, with special emphasis 
      on dengue: (1) How many variables should be used to make predictions about the 
      future of vector-borne diseases? (2) Is the spatial resolution of a climate dataset 
      an important determinant of model accuracy? (3) Does inclusion of the future 
      distributions of vectors affect predictions of the futures of the diseases they 
      transmit? (4) Which are the key predictor variables involved in determining the 
      distributions of vector-borne diseases in the present and future? Examples are given 
      of dengue models using one, five or 10 meteorological variables and at spatial 
      resolutions of from one-sixth to two degrees. Model accuracy is improved with a 
      greater number of descriptor variables, but is surprisingly unaffected by the 
      spatial resolution of the data. Dengue models with a reduced set of climate 
      variables derived from the HadCM3 global circulation model predictions for the 1980s 
      are improved when risk maps for dengue's two main vectors (Aedes aegypti and Aedes 
      albopictus) are also included as predictor variables; disease and vector models are 
      projected into the future using the global circulation model predictions for the 
      2020s, 2040s and 2080s. The Garthwaite-Koch corr-max transformation is presented as 
      a novel way of showing the relative contribution of each of the input predictor 
      variables to the map predictions.

TI  - Economic Evaluations of Dengue Vaccination in the Southeast Asia Region: Evidence 
      From a Systematic Review.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To review the literature on the cost-effectiveness of dengue vaccination 
      in Southeast Asian countries and possibly to provide recommendations on promoting 
      dengue vaccination in this region. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted to 
      identify relevant articles in 3 major databases (ProQuest, American Society of 
      Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, and PubMed). Complete economic evaluation studies, 
      including willingness-to-pay (WTP) studies, that were conducted in any Southeast 
      Asian country were included in this study. Systematic review, non-full-text, and 
      non-English studies were specifically excluded. RESULTS: Nine selected studies 
      highlighted the economic evaluation of dengue vaccination in Southeast Asian 
      countries by considering many parameters (eg, vaccine cost, vaccine efficacy, 
      cost-effectiveness threshold, economic assessment, public acceptance, and WTP). All 
      studies confirmed that dengue vaccine can be used as a prevention strategy to reduce 
      the incidence rate of dengue cases by providing a variance of high 
      cost-effectiveness values. In addition, communities provided a good assessment, 
      acceptance, and WTP value for the vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: The use of dengue vaccine 
      could reduce the burden of disease and economic burden due to dengue infection in 
      Southeast Asian countries. The efficacy of dengue vaccine was estimated to be 50-95% 
      for those <9 years, 9 years, and >9 years. In particular, several studies reported 
      that dengue vaccine could be categorized as a cost-effective intervention in 
      Southeast Asian countries within certain conditions.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This paper concerns a systematic analysis of dengue illness and costs in 
      India from 2013 to 2016. A previous study for 2006-2012 found that that projected 
      annual number of dengue cases (5.78 million) was 282 times the officially reported 
      number (20,474), highlighting enormous uncertainty. METHODS: This study updated 
      primary data for India from 2012 to 2014 and synthesized the latest epidemiological 
      and economic literature through 2018 using the country and global estimates. 
      RESULTS: The first empirically-based publication of dengue costs by country (in 
      2016) estimated India experienced 18,618,706 symptomatic dengue cases and 1602 
      deaths, and cost $1.51 billion in 2013. With a combination of increased incidence, 
      more refined methods, and better data this 2018 study raised the latest estimates to 
      53,210,706 cases, 22,527 deaths, and $5.71 billion economic costs for 2016, 
      representing increases over the previous publication of 186%, 1306%, and 278%, 
      respectively. When consistent methods and data were used to compare 2013 to 2016, 
      the corresponding changes were only +29%, -9%, and +12%, respectively over these 3 
      years. CONCLUSIONS: India's burden of dengue is substantially greater than 
      previously estimated. Although uncertainty intervals remain wide, these latest 
      estimates reinforce the health and economic benefits that India would realize if 
      dengue were substantially controlled.

AB  - Dengue-related mortality has significantly reduced with early and appropriate fluid 
      resuscitation. However, we continue to see dengue-related fatalities in patients 
      despite early intervention and advanced critical care support. This was a 
      retrospective study conducted at a tertiary care private hospital in Mumbai, India. 
      All patients dying of dengue in the calendar year 2017 were studied. Details related 
      to age, gender, condition at presentation, laboratory parameters, treatment 
      administered, and time to death were abstracted from case records. A total of 575 
      patients with a diagnosis of dengue were admitted to the hospital in 2017, of which 
      15 died (mortality rate 2.6%). Four patients died in the emergency medical unit; 11 
      patients who died after admission to the inpatient unit had multi-organ dysfunction 
      at the time of presentation, with shock, severe liver dysfunction, and severe 
      metabolic acidosis. Only 4/11 patients had hemoconcentration, and 10/11 patients had 
      high white cell counts. In five patients where serum ferritin was performed, it was 
      more than 40,000 ng/mL. Death occurred at a median time of 2 days after 
      hospitalization despite good supportive care. Although there is scope for 
      improvement of supportive care in these patients, it appears that other 
      interventions are urgently needed to improve outcomes in severe dengue. This calls 
      for more research into the immunopathology of dengue, evaluation of 
      anti-inflammatory drugs, intravenous immunoglobulins, antivirals, and improved 
      vaccines.

AB  - A dengue fever epidemic which occurred in Ribeirão Preto County, S. Paulo State, 
      Brazil, during the period November, 1990 to March, 1991 has been analysed elsewhere. 
      The general aspects of dengue epidemiology and control have been reviewed in this 
      article. Emphasis is given to the analysis of some factors involved in the risk of 
      dengue haemorrhagic fever and ecological aspects of the vector, as well as to the 
      appropriateness of strategies for dengue eradication or control. Epidemiological 
      characteristics of dengue, mainly those related to its occurrence in different 
      geographical areas and periods of time are described. The Ribeirão Preto epidemic 
      has thus, been set within the context of the spread of the disease at global level, 
      in the Americas, and particularly in Brazil and S. Paulo State.

TI  - Clinical Profile, Liver Dysfunction and Outcome of Dengue Infection in Children: A 
      Prospective Observational Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Liver involvement in dengue illness is common and can lead to acute 
      liver failure (ALF). No single method can effectively identify patients at risk for 
      disease progression and bad outcome. We aimed to determine the relationship between 
      liver dysfunction, kinetics of liver function tests (LFTs) and severity of hepatitis 
      on the outcome in pediatric dengue illness. METHODS: We conducted a prospective 
      observational study of hospitalized children (1-12 years) with dengue infection 
      (July 2014-July 2015). Serial monitoring of LFTs was done in confirmed dengue cases. 
      Patients were classified into non-severe (NSD) and severe dengue (SD). Severity of 
      hepatitis was graded: mild, moderate and severe hepatitis. Events were noted during 
      hospitalization. RESULTS: One hundred two children (66, boys), median age 72 (48-96) 
      months, were analyzed (NSD, n = 41; SD, n = 61). Elevated transaminases (92%) was 
      the most common abnormality; aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase 
      (ALT) in 87% and 82%, respectively. Maximum abnormalities in LFTs peaked at day 5 
      (AST, ALT) and day 7 (Alkaline Phosphatase [ALP], gamma-glutamyl transferase) of 
      illness. Elevated transaminases was found to be higher in SD than NSD (100% vs. 80%, 
      P = 0.006). Severe hepatitis developed organ dysfunction such as altered sensorium 
      (P < 0.001), ALF (P < 0.001), acute kidney injury (P < 0.001) and shock (P < 0.001), 
      more commonly than those with mild to moderate hepatitis. Fourteen patients died, 
      two-thirds of whom had severe hepatitis (P < 0.001). Using binary logistic 
      regression, presence of severe hepatitis and shock at presentation was an 
      independent predictor for ALF (odds ratio: 77; 95% confidence interval : 13-457, P < 
      0.001) and mortality (odds ratio: 55; 95% confidence interval: 4.6-66, P < 0.001), 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Many children with dengue have liver involvement. Severe 
      hepatitis in dengue is associated with significant organ dysfunction and poor 
      outcome.

PG  - 1161-8
AB  - The incidence of dengue fever, an acute febrile illness transmitted by the Aedes 
      aegypti mosquito, is on the rise. High fever, severe headache, skin rash and a 
      variety of constitutional symptoms are hallmarks of classic dengue fever. Dengue 
      hemorrhagic fever, a severe manifestation associated with secondary infection, most 
      often occurs in children. Treatment of classic dengue fever is supportive, whereas 
      urgent rehydration therapy is often required in more severe forms. Community-based 
      and personal strategies for avoiding the mosquito vector represent the best methods 
      of prevention, although vaccine development programs are under way.

TI  - Dengue in children: critical points in management.
PG  - 343-6
AB  - Dengue fever (DF) is endemic and occasionally epidemic in many tropical and 
      subtropical areas inhabited by the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti. Infection with 
      Dengue may present with varied clinical manifestations. Significant morbidity and 
      mortality can result if early recognition and monitoring of its severe forms (DHF 
      and DSS) is not done and if appropriate medical intervention is delayed. This 
      article reviews several critical points in the basic evaluation and management of 
      dengue in the pediatric age group and present our current approach in the form of a 
      therapeutic algorithm.

AB  - Dengue disease is caused by dengue viruses 1-4 and has been ranked by the World 
      Health Organisation (WHO) as the fastest spreading vector-borne viral disease. 
      Dengue is often underreported and misdiagnosed due to a wide spectrum of clinical 
      manifestations. Diagnosis of dengue is based on clinical case definitions and 
      laboratory methods. Newer case definitions of dengue have been formulated by 
      clinical studies in order to improve case detection. Owing to its epidemic 
      potential, mortality and morbidity, there is a need for a rapid and accurate 
      diagnostic assay for dengue in order to help the clinician in the early detection of 
      cases and to prevent disease progression. A duplex real time PCR targeting the 3'UTR 
      region for rapid and simultaneous detection of all dengue viruses serotypes (1-4) 
      was standardized based on published literature. About 150 patients with acute 
      undifferentiated febrile illness classified based on the 2009 WHO dengue case 
      definition were tested using the duplex real time dengue PCR. Sequencing based PCR 
      was performed on selected PCR positive samples for partial nucleotide sequence of 
      the CprM gene and a phylogenetic tree was constructed. Statistical analysis was done 
      using the MedCalc software. Out of the 126 patients classified as dengue disease 
      positive, according to the 2009 WHO dengue case definition, 54% had "probable 
      dengue", 43% had "dengue with warning signs" and 3% had "severe dengue". The 
      performance of the duplex real time PCR was assessed among the various clinical 
      groups of dengue and it was found that in the "dengue with warning signs group" PCR 
      had a positive predictive value of 85.29% (range - 68.94% to 95.05%) when compared 
      with dengue NS1 ELISA. The average time for PCR positivity was found to be four days 
      from the onset of illness. The cycling threshold values obtained from real time PCR 
      were used as a semi quantitative measure of viremia. Accordingly, there was a 
      relatively low CT value among the "warning signs dengue group" when compared to the 
      "probable dengue group". The use of the duplex PCR is suggested in the early 
      diagnosis of dengue, especially in the 'warning signs' group of patients as they 
      showed a higher positivity rate. Also, the use of the resultant CT value as a 
      semi-quantitative measure of viremia will assist the clinician in early diagnosis 
      and prevention of disease development.

TI  - Dengue fever in a liver-transplanted patient: a case report.
PG  - 378
LID - 10.1186/1752-1947-8-378 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dengue fever is one of the commonest mosquito-borne diseases in the 
      tropics, and Sri Lanka is no exception. Despite its commonness, dengue fever has 
      rarely been described among patients who have undergone transplantation. We report 
      the case of a patient with dengue fever after liver transplantation, which, to the 
      best of our knowledge, is the first such reported case outside Brazil. CASE 
      PRESENTATION: Our patient was a 46-year-old Sri Lakan man who presented to our 
      institution two years after undergoing an ABO-compatible cadaveric liver transplant. 
      At presentation, he had typical symptoms of dengue fever. He was taking prednisolone 
      5mg daily and tacrolimus 3mg twice daily as immunosuppression. Initial 
      investigations showed thrombocytopenia and neutropenia that reached a nadir by day 7 
      of his illness. He had elevated liver enzymes as well. The diagnosis was confirmed 
      on the basis of NS1 antigen detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. His 
      blood cultures and polymerase chain reaction tests for cytomegalovirus were 
      negative. He made an uneventful recovery and was discharged by day 9 of his illness. 
      However, normalization of liver function took nearly two weeks. In three previously 
      reported Brazilian cases of dengue after liver transplantation, the patients 
      presented with dengue shock syndrome, in contrast to the relatively milder 
      presentation of our patient. Because of the lack of case reports in the literature, 
      it is difficult to ascertain the risk factors for severe dengue infection in 
      transplants, but dengue fever reported in renal transplants sheds some light on 
      them. High-dose steroids increase the risk of thrombocytopenia, whereas tacrolimus 
      has been reported to prolong the duration of symptoms. Otherwise, dengue fever is a 
      relatively mild illness in patients who have undergone renal transplantation, and 
      renal allograft survival has been reported to be 86% following dengue fever. 
      CONCLUSION: Dengue is a rarely reported infection in patients who have undergone 
      transplantation. A high degree of suspicion is required for diagnosis. Dengue NS1 
      antigen detection is a useful addition to the already existing methods of diagnosis. 
      Steroids and tacrolimus have effects on the morbidity of the disease. Graft outcomes 
      following the infection has been excellent in all reported cases.

TI  - WHO 2009 Warning Signs as Predictors of Time Taken for Progression to Severe Dengue 
      in Children.
PG  - 899-903
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify WHO 2009 warning signs that can predict time taken for 
      progression to severe dengue in a pediatric population. DESIGN: Prospective 
      analytical study over 1 year and 2 months. SETTING: Tertiary care center. 
      PARTICIPANTS: 350 children aged 1 mo-12 y with serologically confirmed dengue 
      without co-morbidities/co-infections; conse-cutive sampling. PROCEDURE: At 
      admission, clinical and laboratory details were noted. Disease progression, time of 
      onset of each warning sign, hematocrit, and platelet counts were recorded daily till 
      discharge/ death. If progressing to severe dengue, its time of onset was noted. Time 
      to event analysis with Log Rank test, Kaplan Meier plots and Cox Proportional 
      Hazards Model was done. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was time interval from 
      onset of first warning sign to onset of severe dengue (defined as per WHO 2009 
      guidelines). Predictors were WHO 2009 warning signs: abdominal pain, lethargy, 
      persistent vomiting, mucosal bleed, clinical fluid accumulation, hepatomegaly >2 cm, 
      hematocrit ≥0.40 and platelet count <100x109/L. RESULTS: Among 350 children followed 
      up completely till discharge/death, 90 developed severe dengue (event) while 260 did 
      not (censored). Median age of study population was 7.75 y. Clinical fluid 
      accumulation [(P=0.002, Hazard Ratio (HR) 2.19, 95% CI 1.33-3.60)] and hematocrit 
      ≥0.40 [(P=0.009, HR (95%CI) 1.715, (1.13-2.60)] were significant in univariate 
      analysis. Final multivariate model includes clinical fluid accumulation [(P=0.02, HR 
      (95%CI) 1.89, (1.116-3.202)], hematocrit ≥0.40 (P=0.07), mucosal bleed (P=0.56) and 
      persistent vomiting (P=0.32). CONCLUSION: WHO warning signs that predict time taken 
      for progression to severe dengue in children include clinical fluid accumulation, 
      hematocrit ≥0.40, persistent vomiting and mucosal bleed. Study results have 
      implications in policy making and practice guidelines to triage children attending a 
      health care facility with or without warning signs.

TI  - [The situation of dengue in the world].
PG  - 87-90
AB  - The situation of dengue in the world can be summarized as follows: 2,5 billions 
      persons at risk, 60 millions cases per year, and 30 000 deaths per year. The four 
      dengue serotypes, DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 and DEN-4 are nearly human-specific. Clinical 
      symptoms of dengue vary from unapparent infection, mild febrile manifestations to 
      hemorrhagic forms with or without shock syndrome. Dengue viruses are transmitted by 
      Aedes mosquitoes, the most important vectors being Aedes aegypti and Aedes 
      albopictus. The epidemiology of the disease can be divided into endemo-epidemic 
      situations occurring in South-East Asia, and epidemic situations found in Pacific 
      islands, Africa and Tropical America. Maintenance of dengue is supported by an 
      increasing demography, uncontrolled urbanization and climatic conditions favorable 
      to the vectors. Spread of dengue is primarily caused by modern transportation means, 
      especially the aircraft. The geographical distribution of dengue is pantropical, 
      except for Madagascar and some african regions. Because no vaccine and no specific 
      treatment actually exist against dengue viruses, mosquito control is the only way to 
      reduce the incidence of dengue around the world. However, the evolution of the 
      dengue situation is not satisfactory.

AB  - Since dengue was first documented in Malaysia in 1902 and made notifiable in 1973, 
      the disease pattern has changed from major outbreaks every four years to one of 
      increasing trend yearly. The largest outbreak was seen in 1996 with 14,255 dengue 
      cases reported and 32 deaths. The case fatality rate varied from a high of 10.43% in 
      1985 when dengue type 3 was the predominant type to a low of 1.29% when dengue type 
      1 predominated. Severe disease patterns have been observed with dengue 2 and 3 
      serotypes in the country. The clinical spectrum has also been changing and 
      multisystem involvement with more severe manifestations are being seen. Liver 
      involvement has been documented since 1987. Fulminant hepatitis with encephalopathy 
      can resemble Reye's syndrome. Dengue type 3 has been isolated from liver biopsy 
      specimens. Neurological manifestations can very from irritability, convulsions, coma 
      to peripheral neuritis. The isolation of dengue viruses from cerebrospinal fluids 
      recently strongly suggests that dengue viruses can be neurovirulent. Adult 
      respiratory distress syndrome was seen in three children admitted with shock. Deaths 
      were more frequent in children in the early period but since 1982, over 50% of 
      deaths have occurred in patients over the age of 15 years.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Dengue viral infection is an ongoing epidemic in Sri Lanka, causing 
      significant mortality and morbidity. A descriptive-analytical study was carried out 
      using serologically confirmed Dengue patients during a 6 month period. The 
      relationship between the elevation of hepatic enzymes and severity of Dengue was 
      assessed after stratifying recorded maximum AST/ALT (SGOT/SGPT) values 2-15 times 
      elevated and by the phases of the illness. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive 
      values, and ROC curves were assessed using maximum values for AST and ALT. RESULTS: 
      Out of 255 patients, 107(42%) were females. The majority (52.9%) were in the 
      20-39 year age group. Only 19.6% had DHF. No statistically significant difference 
      was noticed in the values of maximum transaminases during the febrile phase among DF 
      and DHF patients. Higher sensitivity and low specificity with the 1-5 times 
      elevation range was noticed, and a higher cut-off level of more than 5 times 
      elevation showed low sensitivity and higher specificity. The combination of both 
      transaminases cut-offs with age and sex also does not show clinically significant 
      predictability of severe disease. The AST and ALT elevations are not showing 
      discriminatory predictive value on dengue severity. As different serotypes cause 
      different epidemics, it is important to carry out large-scale specific studies 
      considering the serotypes.

TI  - Estimating the burden of dengue and the impact of release of wMel Wolbachia-infected 
      mosquitoes in Indonesia: a modelling study.
PG  - 172
LID - 10.1186/s12916-019-1396-4 [doi]
LID - 172
AB  - BACKGROUND: Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes reduce dengue virus transmission, and 
      city-wide releases in Yogyakarta city, Indonesia, are showing promising 
      entomological results. Accurate estimates of the burden of dengue, its spatial 
      distribution and the potential impact of Wolbachia are critical in guiding funder 
      and government decisions on its future wider use. METHODS: Here, we combine multiple 
      modelling methods for burden estimation to predict national case burden 
      disaggregated by severity and map the distribution of burden across the country 
      using three separate data sources. An ensemble of transmission models then predicts 
      the estimated reduction in dengue transmission following a nationwide roll-out of 
      wMel Wolbachia. RESULTS: We estimate that 7.8 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 
      1.8-17.7 million) symptomatic dengue cases occurred in Indonesia in 2015 and were 
      associated with 332,865 (UI 94,175-754,203) lost disability-adjusted life years 
      (DALYs). The majority of dengue's burden was due to non-severe cases that did not 
      seek treatment or were challenging to diagnose in outpatient settings leading to 
      substantial underreporting. Estimated burden was highly concentrated in a small 
      number of large cities with 90% of dengue cases occurring in 15.3% of land area. 
      Implementing a nationwide Wolbachia population replacement programme was estimated 
      to avert 86.2% (UI 36.2-99.9%) of cases over a long-term average. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      results suggest interventions targeted to the highest burden cities can have a 
      disproportionate impact on dengue burden. Area-wide interventions, such as 
      Wolbachia, that are deployed based on the area covered could protect people more 
      efficiently than individual-based interventions, such as vaccines, in such dense 
      environments.

TI  - Knowledge, attitudes, and practices about dengue among pupils from rural schools in 
      an endemic area in Colombia.
PG  - 478-490

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dengue is a public health problem in tropical and subtropical regions 
      of the world. Studies on dengue in rural areas are scarce since the disease is 
      considered mainly urban. OBJECTIVE: To determine the knowledge (K), attitudes (A) 
      and practices (P) of dengue in an endemic area in Colombia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      We conducted a cross-sectional study with 515 pupils (7-16 years old) in 34 rural 
      schools in Anapoima and La Mesa municipalities during 2011. Each KAP category was 
      evaluated independently by a scoring system and then categorized into high, medium 
      or low. RESULTS: Pupils recognized knowledge variables such as the symptoms (fever, 
      bone pain), transmission route (mosquito bites), and mosquito breeding sites 
      (uncovered water tanks, solid waste). Average scores on attitude were high in both 
      municipalities indicating a well-developed perception of disease severity. Seeking 
      treatment in medical centers and self-medication for fever management and the use of 
      mosquito net and space-spraying of insecticides were the most frequently identified 
      practices. DISCUSSION: This is the first KAP dengue study performed in a rural area 
      in Colombia and as such it contributes to the understanding of dengue perceptions by 
      the inhabitants of these areas. It showed a medium level of knowledge about dengue 
      and a lower level of preventive practices in pupils from rural schools. It also 
      showed that pupils considered space-spraying as crucial for vector control. The 
      presence of the vector in rural areas of the country underlines the need to improve 
      surveillance and education to more effectively control the vector and promote 
      prevention methods including community participation.

PG  - 4225-7
AB  - In the 1950s dengue fever left its home in South-East Asia. The result, as we see it 
      40 years later, is terrifying. From being an almost unknown infection, dengue fever 
      is today's most common arboviral disease with up to 100 million cases annually. In 
      addition, the clinical picture has changed from a benign influenza-like disorder 
      (classic dengue fever) to a serious disease with bleeding and hypovolemic shock 
      (dengue hemorrhagic fever). In this article the authors give an overview of the 
      present epidemiology, prognosis and possible preventive measures against dengue 
      fever.

PG  - S29-44
AB  - Dengue is a viral disease with clinical features that vary in intensity according to 
      certain host and viral strain characteristics. Dengue hemorrhagic fever is 
      practically a new clinical entity for the majority of physicians in the Americas and 
      therefore the need to disseminate the most important clinical and epidemiological 
      features that allow for the opportune diagnosis and therapy. The clinical spectrum 
      of the disease includes asymptomatic to severe hemorrhagic forms and each stage has 
      its own signs and symptoms. This clinical description explores the physiological 
      mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic fever. This paper 
      gives special emphasis to the alarm signs that foretell the presentation of the 
      shock syndrome requiring emergency treatment and advances a classification scheme 
      for epidemics. This scheme identifies the type of treatment and which patients need 
      observation, laboratory tests and hospital care.

TI  - Dengue Fever in travelers returning from southeast Asia.
PG  - 208-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue fever is an important illness facing travelers from nonendemic to 
      endemic countries. METHODS: We reviewed 696 consecutive returned travelers managed 
      at an Australian tertiary-care hospital for an illness acquired overseas. Patients 
      with dengue fever were compared to those with a dengue-like illness, malaria, 
      typhoid fever and rickettsial infections. RESULTS: In total, 19 cases of dengue 
      fever and 20 cases of dengue-like illness were diagnosed, with 85% of cases acquired 
      in Asia. The most common presenting features of dengue were fever (100%), myalgia 
      (79%), rash (74%), headache (68%), nausea (37%), and diarrhea (37%). Compared to 
      those with malaria, typhoid fever and rickettsial infections, patients with dengue 
      were significantly more likely to have myalgia and a temperature <39 degrees C. 
      Compared to all other illnesses in our returned travelers, dengue fever was 18 times 
      more likely if fever and leukopenia were present, 71 times if fever and rash were 
      present, and 230 times if fever, rash and leukopenia were present. All patients with 
      dengue recovered completely. CONCLUSIONS: Dengue fever is an important health 
      problem for travelers not only to Southeast Asia but to all endemic countries. The 
      prevalence appears to be increasing in travelers, and health care professionals need 
      to be familiar with its presentation in travelers. The clinical presenting features 
      provide important guides to establishing the diagnosis.

AB  - A simple mathematical model without seasonality indicated that the apparently 
      chaotic dengue epidemics in Singapore have characteristics similar to epidemics 
      resulting from chance. Randomness as a sufficient condition for patterns of dengue 
      epidemics in equatorial regions calls into question existing explanations for dengue 
      outbreaks there.
